  BUG: doc comments changed.
File "_none_", line 0, characters -1--1::
Error: Formatting of doc-comment is unstable (e.g. parses as a list or not depending on the margin):
2,4c2,5
<     {ul
<     {- registered into {!resolvers}}
<     {- used as a service with {!serve_with_handler]/{!serve}}}
---
> 
>     - registered into {!resolvers}
>     - used as a service with {!serve_with_handler\]/\{!serve}

Please tighten up this comment in the source or disable the formatting using the option --no-parse-docstrings.
