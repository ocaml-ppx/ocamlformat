ocamlformat: ignoring "error3.ml" (misplaced documentation comments - warning 50)
File "error3.ml", line 2, characters 0-13:
Warning 50: ambiguous documentation comment
File "error3.ml", line 3, characters 8-16:
Warning 50: unattached documentation comment (ignored)
Hint: (Warning 50) This file contains a documentation comment (** ... *) that the OCaml compiler does not know how to attach to the AST. OCamlformat does not support these cases. You can find more information at: https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat#overview. If you'd like to disable this check and let ocamlformat make a choice (though it might not be consistent with the ocaml compilers and odoc), you can set the --no-comment-check option.
