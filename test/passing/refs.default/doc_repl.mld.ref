Block delimiters should be on their own line:

{[
  let x = 1
]}

As of odoc 2.1, a block can carry metadata:

{@ocaml[
  let x = 2
]}

An OCaml block that should break:

{[
  let x = 2 in
  x + x
]}

A toplevel phrase with no output:

{[
  # let x = 2 and y = 3 in
    x + y
    ;;
]}

A toplevel phrase with output:

{[
  # let x = 2;;
  val x : int = 2
]}

Many toplevel phrases without output:

{[
  # let x = 2;;
  # x + 2;;
  # let x = 2 and y = 3 in
    x + y
    ;;
]}

Many toplevel phrases with output:

{[
  # let x = 2;;
  val x : int = 2
  # x + 2;;
  - : int = 4
  # let x = 2 and y = 3 in
    x + y
    ;;
]}

Output are printed after a newline:

{[
  # let x = 2;; val x : int = 2
  # let x = 3;;
  # let x = 4;; val x : int = 4
]}

Excessive linebreaks are removed:

{[
  # let x = 2 in
    x + 1
    ;;
  output
  # let y = 3 in
    y + 1
    ;;
]}

Linebreak after `#`:

{[
  # let x = 2 in
    x + 1
    ;;
]}

Invalid toplevel phrase/ocaml block:
{[
  - : int =
   4
]}
