ocamlformat: ignoring "tests/error3.ml" (misplaced documentation comments - warning 50)
File "tests/error3.ml", line 2, characters 0-13:
2 | (** a or b *)
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Warning 50 [unexpected-docstring]: ambiguous documentation comment
File "tests/error3.ml", line 3, characters 8-16:
3 | let b = (** ? *) ()          
            ^^^^^^^^
Warning 50 [unexpected-docstring]: unattached documentation comment (ignored)
Hint: (Warning 50) This file contains a documentation comment (** ... *) that the OCaml compiler does not know how to attach to the AST. OCamlformat does not support these cases. You can find more information at: https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat#overview. If you'd like to disable this check and let ocamlformat make a choice (though it might not be consistent with the ocaml compilers and odoc), you can set the --no-comment-check option.
