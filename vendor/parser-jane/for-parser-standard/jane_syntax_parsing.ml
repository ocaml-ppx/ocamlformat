(** As mentioned in the .mli file, there are some gory details around the
    particular translation scheme we adopt for moving to and from OCaml ASTs
    ([Parsetree.expression], etc.).  The general idea is that we adopt a scheme
    where each novel piece of syntax is represented using one of two embeddings:

    1. As an AST item carrying an attribute. The AST item serves as the "body"
      of the syntax indicated by the attribute.
    2. As a pair of an extension node and an AST item that serves as the "body".
       Here, the "pair" is embedded as a pair-like construct in the relevant AST
       category, e.g. [include sig [%jane.ERASABILITY.EXTNAME];; BODY end] for
       signature items.

    In particular, for an language extension named [EXTNAME] (i.e., one that is
    enabled by [-extension EXTNAME] on the command line), the attribute (if
    used) must be [[@jane.ERASABILITY.EXTNAME]], and the extension node (if
    used) must be [[%jane.ERASABILITY.EXTNAME]]. For built-in syntax, we use
    [_builtin] instead of an language extension name.

    The [ERASABILITY] component indicates to tools such as ocamlformat and
    ppxlib whether or not the attribute is erasable. See the documentation of
    [Erasability] for more information on how tools make use of this
    information.

    In the below example, we use attributes an examples, but it applies equally
    to extensions. We also provide utilities for further desugaring similar
    applications where the embeddings have the longer form
    [[@jane.ERASABILITY.FEATNAME.ID1.ID2.….IDn]] (with the outermost one being
    the [n = 0] case), as these might be used inside the [EXPR]. (For example,
    within the outermost [[@jane.non_erasable.comprehensions]] term for list and
    array comprehensions, we can also use
    [[@jane.non_erasable.comprehensions.list]],
    [[@jane.non_erasable.comprehensions.array]],
    [[@jane.non_erasable.comprehensions.for.in]], etc.).

    As mentioned, we represent terms as a "pair" and don't use the extension
    node or attribute payload; this is so that ppxen can see inside these
    extension nodes or attributes. If we put the subexpressions inside the
    payload, then we couldn't write something like [[[%string "Hello, %{x}!"]
    for x in names]], as [ppx_string] wouldn't traverse inside the payload to
    find the [[%string]] extension node.

    Our novel syntactic features are of course allowed to impose extra
    constraints on what legal bodies are; we're also happy for this translation
    to error in various ways on malformed input, since nobody should ever be
    writing these forms directly.  They're just an implementation detail.

    See modules of type AST below to see how different syntactic categories
    are represented. For example, expressions are encoded using an attribute.

    We provide one module per syntactic category (e.g., [Expression]), of module
    type [AST].  They also provide some simple machinery for working with the
    general [@jane.ERASABILITY.FEATNAME.ID1.ID2.….IDn] wrapped forms. To
    construct one, we provide [make_jane_syntax]; to destructure one, we provide
    [match_jane_syntax] (which we expose via [make_of_ast]). Users of this
    module still have to write the transformations in both directions for all
    new syntax, lowering it to extension nodes or attributes and then lifting it
    back out. *)

(** How did we choose between using the attribute embedding and the extension
    node embedding for a particular syntactic category?

    Generally, we prefer the attribute embedding: it's more compatible with
    ppxes that aren't aware of Jane Syntax. (E.g., if a type looks like a tuple,
    it truly is a tuple and not an extension node embedding.)

    We can't apply the attribute embedding everywhere because some syntactic
    categories, like structure items, don't carry attributes. For these, we
    use extension nodes.

    However, the attribute embedding is more inconvenient in some ways than
    the extension node embedding. For example, the attribute embedding requires
    callers to strip out Jane Syntax-related attributes from the attribute list
    before processing it. We've tried to make this obvious from the signature
    of, say, [Jane_syntax.Expression.of_ast], but this is somewhat more
    inconvenient than just operating on the [expr_desc]. Nonetheless, because
    of the advantages with ppxlib interoperability, we've opted for the
    attribute embedding where possible.

(** The component of an attribute or extension name that identifies whether or

    upstream OCaml compiler can safely interpret the AST while ignoring the
    attribute or extension.  (This means that syntax encoded as extension
    nodes should always be non-erasable.)  Tools that consume the parse tree
    we generate can make use of this information; for instance, ocamlformat
    will use it to guide how we present code that can be run with both our
    compiler and the upstream compiler, and ppxlib can use it to decide
    whether it's ok to allow ppxes to construct syntax that uses this
    emedding.  In particular, the upstream version of ppxlib will allow ppxes
    to produce [[@jane.erasable.*]] attributes, but will report an error if a
    ppx produces a [[@jane.non_erasable.*]] attribute.

    As mentioned above, unlike for attributes, the erasable/non-erasable
    distinction is not meaningful for extension nodes, as the compiler will
    always error if it sees an uninterpreted extension node. So, for purposes
    of tools in the wider OCaml ecosystem, it is irrelevant whether embeddings
    that use extension nodes indicate [Erasable] or [Non_erasable] for this
    component, but the semantically correct choice and the one we've settled
