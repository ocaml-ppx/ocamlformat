(** Auxiliary Jane Street extensions to AST types used by parsetree and
    typedtree.

    This file exists because [Asttypes] is considered part of the parse tree,
    and we can't modify the parse tree.  This also enables us to build other
    files with the upstream compiler as long as [jane_asttypes.mli] is present;
    see Note [Buildable with upstream] in jane_syntax.mli for details on that.

  {b Warning:} this module is unstable and part of
  {{!Compiler_libs}compiler-libs}.

*)

(** [const_jkind] is private to limit confusion with type variables, which
    are also strings in the parser.
