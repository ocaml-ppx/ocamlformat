(** This module handles the logic around the syntax of our extensions to OCaml
    for Jane Street, keeping the gory details wrapped up behind a clean
    interface.

    As we've started to work on syntactic extensions to OCaml, three concerns
    arose about the mechanics of how we wanted to maintain these changes in our
    fork.

    1. We don't want to extend the AST for our fork, as we really want to make
       sure things like ppxen are cross-compatible between upstream and our
       fork.  Thankfully, OCaml already provides places to add extra syntax:
       extension nodes and annotations!  Thus, we have to come up with a way of
       representing our new syntactic constructs in terms of these constructs.

    2. We don't want to actually match on extension nodes or attributes whose
       names are specific strings all over the compiler; that's incredibly
       messy, and it's easy to miss cases, etc.

    3. We want to keep our different novel syntactic features distinct so that
       we can add them to upstream independently, work on them separately, and
       so on.

    We have come up with a design that addresses those concerns by providing
    both a nice compiler-level interface for working with our syntactic
    extensions as first-class AST nodes, as well as a uniform scheme for
    translating this to and from OCaml AST values by using extension nodes or
    attributes.  One wrinkle is that OCaml has many ASTs, one for each syntactic
    category (expressions, patterns, etc.); we have to provide this facility for
    each syntactic category where we want to provide extensions.  A smaller
    wrinkle is that our novel syntactic features come in two varieties:
    *language extensions* (e.g., comprehensions) and *built-in features* (e.g.,
    syntactic function arity).  While the former can be disabled, the latter are
    parse tree changes we rely on (though they won't therefore show up in
    surface syntax).

    a. For each novel syntactic feature, we will define a module (e.g.,
       [Comprehensions]), in which we define a proper AST type per syntactic
       category we care about (e.g., [Comprehensions.expression] and its
       subcomponents).  This addresses concern (3); we've now contained each
       separate feature (and the built-in changes) in a module.  But just doing
       that would leave them too siloed, so…

    b. We define an *overall auxiliary AST* for each syntactic category that's
       just for our novel syntactic features; for expressions, it's called
       [Jane_syntax.Expression.t].  It contains one constructor for each of the
       AST types defined as described in design point (1).  This addresses
       concern (2); we can now match on actual OCaml constructors, as long as we
       can get ahold of them.  And to do that…

    c. We define a general scheme for how we represent our novel syntactic
       features in terms of the existing ASTs, and provide a few primitives for
       consuming/creating AST nodes of this form, for each syntactic category.
       There's not a lot of abstraction to be done, or at least it's not (yet)
       apparent what abstraction there is to do, so most of this remains manual.
       (Setting up a full lens-based/otherwise bidirectional approach sounds
       like a great opportunity for yak-shaving, but not *actually* a good
       idea.)  This solves concern (3), and by doing it uniformly helps us
       address multiple cases at one stroke.

    Then, for each syntactic category, we define a module (in
    [jane_syntax_parsing.ml]) that contains functions for converting between the
    [Parsetree] representation and the higher-level representation. These
    modules are inhabitants of [AST.t], and the [AST] module exposes operations
    on them.

    This module contains the logic for moving to and from OCaml ASTs; the gory
    details of the encoding are detailed in the implementation.  All the actual
    ASTs should live in [Jane_syntax], which is the only module that should
    directly depend on this one.

    When using this module, we often want to specify what our syntax extensions
    look like when desugared into OCaml ASTs, so that we can validate the
    translation code.  We generally specify this as a BNF grammar, but we don't
    want to depend on the specific details of the desugaring.  Thus, instead of
    writing out extension nodes or attributes directly, we write the result of
    [Some_ast.make_extension ~loc [name1; name2; ...; NameN] a] as the special
    syntax [{% 'name1.name2.....nameN' | a %}] in the BNF.  Other pieces of the
    OCaml AST are used as normal.

    One detail which we hide as much as possible is locations: whenever
    constructing an OCaml AST node -- whether with [wrap_desc], the functions in
    [Ast_helper], or some other way -- the location should be left to be
    defaulted (and the default, [!Ast_helper.make_default], should be ghost).
    The [make_entire_jane_syntax] function will handle making sure this default
    location is set appropriately.  If this isn't done and any locations on
    subterms aren't marked as ghost, the compiler will work fine, but ppxlib may
    detect that you've violated its well-formedness constraints and fail to
    parse the resulting AST. *)

   of the Jane Syntax encoding) but I felt it important to document the caller's
   responsibility to plumb through uninterpreted attributes.

   Given that it only has one callsite currently, we decided to keep this
