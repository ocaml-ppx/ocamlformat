(** This module handles the logic around the syntax of our extensions to OCaml
    for Jane Street, keeping the gory details wrapped up behind a clean
    interface.

    As we've started to work on syntactic extensions to OCaml, three concerns
    arose about the mechanics of how we wanted to maintain these changes in our
    fork.

    1. We don't want to extend the AST for our fork, as we really want to make
       sure things like ppxen are cross-compatible between upstream and our
       fork.  Thankfully, OCaml already provides places to add extra syntax:
       extension nodes and annotations!  Thus, we have to come up with a way of
       representing our new syntactic constructs in terms of these constructs.

    2. We don't want to actually match on extension nodes or attributes whose
       names are specific strings all over the compiler; that's incredibly
       messy, and it's easy to miss cases, etc.

    3. We want to keep our different novel syntactic features distinct so that
       we can add them to upstream independently, work on them separately, and
       so on.

    We have come up with a design that addresses those concerns by providing
    both a nice compiler-level interface for working with our syntactic
    extensions as first-class AST nodes, as well as a uniform scheme for
    translating this to and from OCaml AST values by using extension nodes or
    attributes.  One wrinkle is that OCaml has many ASTs, one for each syntactic
    category (expressions, patterns, etc.); we have to provide this facility for
    each syntactic category where we want to provide extensions.  A smaller
    wrinkle is that our novel syntactic features come in two varieties:
    *language extensions* (e.g., comprehensions) and *built-in features* (e.g.,
    syntactic function arity).  While the former can be disabled, the latter are
    parse tree changes we rely on (though they won't therefore show up in
    surface syntax).

    a. For each novel syntactic feature, we will define a module (e.g.,
       [Comprehensions]), in which we define a proper AST type per syntactic
       category we care about (e.g., [Comprehensions.expression] and its
       subcomponents).  This addresses concern (3); we've now contained each
       separate feature (and the built-in changes) in a module.  But just doing
       that would leave them too siloed, so…

    b. We define an *overall auxiliary AST* for each syntactic category that's
       just for our novel syntactic features; for expressions, it's called
       [Jane_syntax.Expression.t].  It contains one constructor for each of the
       AST types defined as described in design point (1).  This addresses
       concern (2); we can now match on actual OCaml constructors, as long as we
       can get ahold of them.  And to do that…

    c. We define a general scheme for how we represent our novel syntactic
       features in terms of the existing ASTs, and provide a few primitives for
       consuming/creating AST nodes of this form, for each syntactic category.
       There's not a lot of abstraction to be done, or at least it's not (yet)
       apparent what abstraction there is to do, so most of this remains manual.
       (Setting up a full lens-based/otherwise bidirectional approach sounds
       like a great opportunity for yak-shaving, but not *actually* a good
       idea.)  This solves concern (3), and by doing it uniformly helps us
       address multiple cases at one stroke.

    Then, for each syntactic category, we define a module (in
    [jane_syntax_parsing.ml]) that contains functions for converting between the
    [Parsetree] representation and the higher-level representation. These
    modules are inhabitants of [AST.t], and the [AST] module exposes operations
    on them.

    This module contains the logic for moving to and from OCaml ASTs; the gory
    details of the encoding are detailed in the implementation.  All the actual
    ASTs should live in [Jane_syntax], which is the only module that should
    directly depend on this one.

    When using this module, we often want to specify what our syntax extensions
    look like when desugared into OCaml ASTs, so that we can validate the
    translation code.  We generally specify this as a BNF grammar, but we don't
    want to depend on the specific details of the desugaring.  Thus, instead of
    writing out extension nodes or attributes directly, we write the result of
    [Some_ast.make_extension ~loc [name1; name2; ...; NameN] a] as the special
    syntax [{% 'name1.name2.....nameN' | a %}] in the BNF.  Other pieces of the
    OCaml AST are used as normal.

    One detail which we hide as much as possible is locations: whenever
    constructing an OCaml AST node -- whether with [wrap_desc], the functions in
    [Ast_helper], or some other way -- the location should be left to be
    defaulted (and the default, [!Ast_helper.make_default], should be ghost).
    The [make_entire_jane_syntax] function will handle making sure this default
    location is set appropriately.  If this isn't done and any locations on
    subterms aren't marked as ghost, the compiler will work fine, but ppxlib may
    detect that you've violated its well-formedness constraints and fail to
    parse the resulting AST. *)

(******************************************************************************)

(** The type enumerating our novel syntactic features, which are either a
    language extension (separated out by which one) or the collection of all
    built-in features. *)
module Feature : sig
  type t =
    | Language_extension : _ Language_extension.t -> t

  (** The component of an attribute or extension name that identifies the
      feature. This is the third component.
  *)
  val extension_component : t -> string
end

(** An AST-style representation of the names used when generating extension
    nodes or attributes for modular syntax.  We use this to abstract over the
    details of how they're encoded, so we have some flexibility in changing them
    (although comments may refer to the specific encoding choices).  This is
    also why we don't expose any functions for rendering or parsing these names;
    that's all handled internally. *)
module Embedded_name : sig
  (** A nonempty list of name components, without the first two components.
      (That is, without the leading root component that identifies it as part of
      the modular syntax mechanism, and without the next component that
      identifies the erasability.)

      This is a nonempty list corresponding to the different components of the
      name: first the feature, and then any subparts.
  *)
  type components = ( :: ) of string * string list

  type t

  (** Creates an embedded name whose erasability component is whether the
      feature is erasable, and whose feature component is the feature's name.
      The second argument is treated as the trailing components after the
      feature name.
  *)
  val of_feature : Feature.t -> string list -> t

  (** Extract the components from an embedded name; just includes the
      user-specified components, not the leading or erasability components, as
      with the [components] type. *)
  val components : t -> components

  (** Create a new "marker attribute".  These are Jane-syntax-style attributes,
      but exist outside of the full Jane syntax machinery; they can be added
      directly to syntax nodes, aren't matched on and turned into ASTs, and so
      on and so forth.  The format of the attribute name is not guaranteed to be
      stable across compiler versions, but it will end with the specified
      components as if they were the second part of a [components] value.

      Given [let make, extract, has = marker_attribute_handler comps], then:

      - [make ~loc] creates the specified marker attribute at the [ghost]
        version of the provided location.
      - [extract attrs] pulls out the specified marker attribute from [attrs],
        and returns all the other attributes if it was present.  If the specified
        marker attribute was not present, returns [None].
      - [has attrs] returns [true] if the list of attributes contains the
        specified marker attribute, and [false] otherwise.  It's equivalent to
        [Option.is_some (extract attrs)]. *)
  val marker_attribute_handler :
    string list -> (loc:Location.t -> Parsetree.attribute)

      error messages. *)
  val pp_quoted_name : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
end

(** Each syntactic category that contains novel syntactic features has a
    corresponding module of this module type.  We're adding these lazily as we
    need them. When you add another one, make sure also to add special handling
    in [Ast_iterator] and [Ast_mapper].

    This module type comes in two varieties: [AST_with_attributes] and
    [AST_without_attributes].  They reflect whether desugaring an OCaml AST into
    our extended one should ([with]) or shouldn't ([without]) return the
    attributes as well.  This choice is recorded in the [with_attributes]
    type. *)

      the generated AST will be set to [!Ast_helper.default_loc], which should
      be [ghost].  The list of components should be nonempty; if it's empty, you

      whole [[x for x in xs]], and not a subcomponent like [for x in xs]).  The
      provided location is used for the location of the resulting AST node.
      Additionally, [Ast_helper.default_loc] is set locally to the [ghost]
      version of that location, which is why the [ast] is generated from a
      function call; it is during this call that the location is so set. *)

      "nested", this means the term ought to be a subcomponent of a
      [make_entire_jane_syntax]-created term, created specifically by
      [make_jane_syntax] with a nonempty list of components.

      For example, to distinguish between the different terms in the
      [-extension local] expression AST, we write:

      {[
        let of_expr =
          Expression.match_jane_syntax_piece feature @@ fun expr -> function
          | ["local"] -> Some (Lexp_local expr)

  type 'a with_attributes

  (** Build an [of_ast] function. The return value of this function should be
      used to implement [of_ast] in modules satisfying the signature
      [Jane_syntax.AST].

      The returned function interprets an AST term in the specified syntactic
      category as a term of the appropriate auxiliary extended AST if possible.
      It raises an error if it finds a term from a disabled extension or if the
      embedding is malformed.

        category, returns [None]; this will be reported as an error. (For
        example: There are no pattern comprehensions, so when building the
        extended pattern AST, this function will return [None] if it spots an
        embedding that claims to be from [Language_extension Comprehensions].)
