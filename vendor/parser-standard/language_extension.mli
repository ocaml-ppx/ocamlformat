(** Permanently restrict the allowable extensions to those that are

    to ensure that some code is guaranteed to be compatible with upstream
    OCaml after rewriting to attributes.  When called, disables any
    currently-enabled non-erasable extensions, including any that are on by
    default.  Causes any future uses of [set ~enabled:true], [enable], and
    their [with_] variants to raise if used with a non-erasable extension.
    The [is_enabled] function will still work on any extensions, it will just
    always return [false] on non-erasable ones.  Will raise if called after
    [disallow_extensions]; the ratchet of extension restriction only goes one
