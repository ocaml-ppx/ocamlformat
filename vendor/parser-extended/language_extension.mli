    harmlessly translated to attributes and compiled with the upstream
    compiler. *)

(** Tooling support: Temporarily enable and disable language extensions; these
    operations are idempotent.  Calls to [set], [enable], [disable], and
    [disallow_extensions] inside the body of the function argument will also
    be rolled back when the function finishes, but this behavior may change;
    nest multiple [with_*] functions instead.  *)

(** Permanently restrict the allowable extensions to those that are
    "erasable", i.e. those that can be harmlessly translated to attributes and
    compiled with the upstream compiler.  Used for [-only-erasable-extensions]
    to ensure that some code is guaranteed to be compatible with upstream
    OCaml after rewriting to attributes.  When called, disables any
    currently-enabled non-erasable extensions, including any that are on by
    default.  Causes any future uses of [set ~enabled:true], [enable], and
    their [with_] variants to raise if used with a non-erasable extension.
    The [is_enabled] function will still work on any extensions, it will just
    always return [false] on non-erasable ones.  Will raise if called after
    [disallow_extensions]; the ratchet of extension restriction only goes one
    way. *)

(** Permanently ban all extensions; used for [-disable-all-extensions] to
    ensure that some code is 100% extension-free.  When called, disables any
    currently-enabled extensions, including the defaults.  Causes any future
    uses of [set ~enabled:true], [enable], and their [with_] variants to
    raise; also causes any future uses of [only_erasable_extensions] to raise.
    The [is_enabled] function will still work, it will just always return
    [false].*)
