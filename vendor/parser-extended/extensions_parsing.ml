(** As mentioned in the .mli file, there are some gory details around the
    particular translation scheme we adopt for moving to and from OCaml ASTs
    ([Parsetree.expression], etc.).  The general idea is that we adopt a scheme
    where a language extension is represented as a pair of an extension node and
    an AST item that serves as the "body".  In particular, for an extension
    named [EXTNAME] (i.e., one that is enabled by [-extension EXTNAME] on the
    command line), the extension node used must be [[%extension.EXTNAME]].  We
    also provide utilities for further desugaring similar applications where the
    extension nodes have the longer form [[%extension.EXTNAME.ID1.ID2.â€¦.IDn]]
    (with the outermost one being the [n = 0] case), as these might be used
    inside the [EXPR].  (For example, within the outermost
    [[%extension.comprehensions]] term for list and array comprehensions, we can
    also use [[%extension.comprehensions.list]],
    [[%extension.comprehensions.array]], [[%extensions.comprehensions.for.in]],
    etc.).

    As mentioned, we represent terms as a "pair" and don't use the extension
    node payload; this is so that ppxen can see inside these extension nodes.
    If we put the subexpressions inside the extension node payload, then we
    couldn't write something like [[[%string "Hello, %{x}!"] for x in names]],
    as [ppx_string] wouldn't traverse inside the payload to find the [[%string]]
    extension point.

    Language extensions are of course allowed to impose extra constraints
    constraints on what legal bodies are; we're also happy for this translation
    to error in various ways on malformed input, since nobody should ever be
    writing these forms directly.  They're just an implementation detail.

    See modules of type AST below to see how different syntactic categories
    are represented. For example, expressions are rendered as an application
    of the extension node to the body, i.e. [([%extension.EXTNAME] EXPR)].

    We provide one module per syntactic category (e.g., [Expression]), of module
    type [AST].  They also provide some simple machinery for working with the
    general [%extension.EXTNAME.ID1.ID2.â€¦.IDn] wrapped forms.  To construct
    one, we provide [extension_expr]; to destructure one, we provide
    [match_extension] in the various AST modules; to construct one, we provide
    [make_extension] in the same places..  We still have to write the
    transformations in both directions for all new syntax, lowering it to
    extension nodes and then lifting it back out. *)
