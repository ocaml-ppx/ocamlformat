# OCamlFormat

OCamlFormat is a tool to format OCaml code.

OCamlFormat works by parsing source code using the OCaml compiler's standard parser, deciding where to place comments in the parse tree, and writing the parse tree and comments in a consistent style.

See the source code of OCamlFormat itself and [Infer](https://github.com/facebook/infer) for examples of the styles of code it produces.

## Features

### Overview

OCamlFormat requires source code that meets the following conditions:

- Does not trigger warning 50 (“Unexpected documentation comment.”). For code that triggers warning 50, it is unlikely that ocamlformat will happen to preserve the documentation string attachment.

- Parses without any preprocessing, using the version of the standard ocaml (not camlp4) parser used to build ocamlformat. Attributes and extension points should be correctly preserved, but other mechanisms such as camlp4, cppo, etc. will not work.

- Is either a module implementation (`.ml`), an interface (`.mli`) or a sequence of toplevel phrases (`.mlt`). dune files in ocaml syntax also work.

Under those conditions, ocamlformat is expected to produce output equivalent to the input. As a safety check in case of bugs, prior to terminating or modifying any input file, ocamlformat enforces the following checks:

- The parse trees obtained by parsing the original and formatted files are equal up to some minor normalization (see [`Normalize`](./src/Normalize.ml)`.equal_impl` or `equal_intf`).

- The documentation strings, and their attachment, has been preserved (implicit in the parse tree check).

- The set of comments in the original and formatted files is the same up to their location.

### Code style

There are a number of preset code style profiles, selected using the `--profile` option by passing `--profile=<name>` on the command line or adding `profile = <name>` to an .ocamlformat configuration file. Each profile is a collection of settings for all options, overriding lower priority configuration of individual options. So a profile can be selected and then individual options can be overridden if desired.

The `conventional` or `default` profile aims to be as familiar and "conventional" appearing as the available options allow.

The `ocamlformat` profile aims to take advantage of the strengths of a parsetree-based auto-formatter, and to limit the consequences of the weaknesses imposed by the current implementation. This is a style which optimizes for what the formatter can do best, rather than to match the style of any existing code. Instead of familiarity, the focus is on legibility, keeping the common cases reasonably compact while attempting to avoid confusing formatting in corner cases. General guidelines that have directed the design include:

- Legibility, in the sense of making it as hard as possible for quick visual parsing to give the wrong interpretation, is of highest priority;

- Whenever possible the high-level structure of the code should be obvious by looking only at the left margin, in particular, it should not be necessary to visually jump from left to right hunting for critical keywords, tokens, etc;

- All else equal compact code is preferred as reading without scrolling is easier, so indentation or white space is avoided unless it helps legibility;

- Attention has been given to making some syntactic gotchas visually obvious.

The `compact` profile is similar to `ocamlformat` but opts for a generally more compact code style.

The `sparse` profile is similar to `ocamlformat` but opts for a generally more sparse code style.

If no profile is selected, the `conventional` one is used.

### Options

The full options' documentation is available in [ocamlformat-help.txt] and through `ocamlformat --help`.
Options can be modified by the means of:
- an .ocamlformat configuration file with an `option = VAL` line
- using the `OCAMLFORMAT` environment variable: `OCAMLFORMAT=option=VAL,...,option=VAL`
- an optional parameter on the command line
- a global `[@@@ocamlformat "option=VAL"]` attribute in the processed file
- an `[@@ocamlformat "option=VAL"]` attribute on an expression in the processed file

.ocamlformat files in the containing and all ancestor directories for each input file are used, as well as the global .ocamlformat file defined in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ocamlformat`. The global .ocamlformat file has the lowest priority, then the closer the directory is to the processed file, the higher the priority.

When the option `--enable-outside-detected-project` is not set, .ocamlformat files outside of the project (including the one in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) are not read. The project root of an input file is taken to be the nearest ancestor directory that contains a .git or .hg or dune-project file. If no config file is found, formatting is disabled.

An `.ocamlformat-ignore` file specifies files that OCamlFormat should ignore.  Each line in an `.ocamlformat-ignore` file specifies a filename relative to the directory containing the `.ocamlformat-ignore` file. Lines starting with `#` are ignored and can be used as comments.

### Diff

[`ocamlformat-diff`](./tools/ocamlformat-diff/README.md) uses OCamlFormat to apply the same formatting to compared OCaml files, so that the formatting differences between the two files are not displayed. It can easily be used with `git diff`.

## Installation

OCamlFormat can be installed with `opam`:

```
opam install ocamlformat
```

Alternately, see [`ocamlformat.opam`](./ocamlformat.opam) for manual build instructions.

## Editor setup

### Disable outside project

As mentioned in the Options section, when the option `--disable-outside-detected-project` is set, .ocamlformat files outside of the project (including the one in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) are not read. The project root of an input file is taken to be the nearest ancestor directory that contains a .git or .hg or dune-project file. If no config file is found, then the formatting is disabled.

This feature is often the behavior you can expect from OCamlFormat when it is directly run from your text editor, so it is advised to use this option.

### Emacs setup

- add `$(opam config var share)/emacs/site-lisp` to `load-path` (as done by `opam user-setup install`)

- add `(require 'ocamlformat)` to `.emacs`

- optionally add the following to `.emacs` to bind `C-M-<tab>` to the ocamlformat command and install a hook to run ocamlformat when saving:
```
(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook (lambda ()
  (define-key tuareg-mode-map (kbd "C-M-<tab>") #'ocamlformat)
  (add-hook 'before-save-hook #'ocamlformat-before-save)))
```

To pass the option `--disable-outside-detected-project` (or `--disable`) to OCamlFormat:
- run `emacs`
- run `M-x customize-group⏎` then enter `ocamlformat⏎`
- select the Ocamlformat Enable item
- select the OCamlformat mode in the Value Menu: `Enable` (by default), `Disable` or `Disable outside detected project`
- save the buffer (`C-x C-s`) then enter `yes⏎` and exit

Other OCamlFormat options can be set in .ocamlformat configuration files.

### Vim setup

- be sure the `ocamlformat` binary can be found in PATH

- install the [Neoformat](https://github.com/sbdchd/neoformat#install) plugin

Optional: You can change the options passed to OCamlFormat (to use the option `--disable-outside-detected-project` for example), you can [customize NeoFormat](https://github.com/sbdchd/neoformat#config-optional) with:
```
let g:neoformat_ocaml_ocamlformat = {
            \ 'exe': 'ocamlformat',
            \ 'no_append': 1,
            \ 'stdin': 1,
            \ 'args': ['--disable-outside-detected-project', '--name', '"%:p"', '-']
            \ }

let g:neoformat_enabled_ocaml = ['ocamlformat']
```

## Documentation

OCamlFormat is documented in its man page and through its internal help:

* `ocamlformat --help`
* `man ocamlformat`

You can also view it [online](ocamlformat-help.txt).

## Reason

OCamlFormat is influenced by and follows the same basic design as `refmt` for [Reason](https://github.com/facebook/reason), but outputs OCaml instead of Reason.

Support for converting Reason to OCaml is included in the `ocamlformat_reason` package, which works by using `refmt` to parse Reason into an OCaml parse tree. The Reason converter can be installed using `opam`:
```
opam pin add ocamlformat_reason https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat.git
```
