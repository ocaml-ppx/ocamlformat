# üé® ocamlformat

ocamlformat is a tool for formatting OCaml code. It automatically adjusts the layout of your code to follow the recommended style guidelines, making it easier to read and understand.

## üöÄ Installation

To use ocamlformat, you will need to have [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) and [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) (the OCaml package manager) installed on your system.

Once you have these dependencies, installation is a breeze! Just run the following command:

```
opam install ocamlformat
```

## üíª Usage

Formatting your code with ocamlformat is super simple! Just run the following command:

```
ocamlformat file.ml
```

You can also specify a configuration file to customize the formatting behavior of ocamlformat.
To set up your project to use the default profile and the ocamlformat version you installed let's create a configuration file named `.ocamlformat` containing:

```
profile = default
version = 0.25.1
```

For more information on configuration options, check out the [documentation](https://ocaml.org/p/ocamlformat) or run `ocamlformat --help`.

The most convenient way to format your code is through the `dune` build system. Just run the following command:

```
dune fmt
```
