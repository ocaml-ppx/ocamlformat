## v3.0.0 (2020-08-23)

* Update for release of 4.11.0 and 4.10.1.

Interface changes:
* Change signature of `Configure_options.to_configure_flag` to
  take an OCaml version, and add support for post-autoconf
  flags in OCaml 4.08+ (#13 @avsm).
* Add some extra configure options for modern OCaml (@avsm).
* Add a `trunk_variants` that has additional tests that a
  full OCaml test run can use (like disable-flat-float-array).
* Add comparison and equality functions to `Configure_options`.
* Remove dependency on Result compatibility module and use
  Stdlib, which bumps up the minimum OCaml version to 4.07.0 (@avsm)
* Add conversion functions to go from Docker and opam
  representations of architecture strings (@avsm)

Base images:
* Remove safe-string variants from the compiler build images,
  as the era of safe string migration is behind us.
* Add in no-naked-pointers, disable-float-array to compiler
  trunk variants, as they need to be actively tested.

## v2.6.1 (2020-07-15)

* Fix `arch_of_string` to work with i386 strings (@avsm).

## v2.6.0 (2020-07-14)

* Mark trunk as 4.12.0 and add the 4.11 as a development beta (@avsm).
* Add i386 architecture (@dinosaure @avsm)
* Add a `arch_is_32bit` to determine if wordsize is 32-bits. (@avsm)

## v2.5.0 (2020-03-22)

* Add OCaml 4.09.1 and 4.10.0 releases (@avsm @kit-ty-kate).
* Add `equal` function to test versions for equality (#7 @kit-ty-kate)
* Add a top-level printer hint for `Ocaml_version.t` (@avsm)

## v2.4.0 (2020-02-20)

* Add `unreleased_betas` list to enumerate the latest release-candidate
  version for each unreleased minor OCaml series (#4 @craigfe).
* Do not `open Result` to clean up internal code (#5 @avsm).

## v2.3.0 (2019-08-29)

* Support OCaml 4.02.3, which brings back a dependency on
  the `result` library.

## v2.2.0

* Add OCaml 4.08.1 release

## v2.1.0 (2019-06-26)
* Add OCaml 4.08.0 release
* Add support for 4.10 as the new trunk.

## v2.0.0 (2019-02-06)

* Reinstate OCaml 4.02 to the "recent" list after a request
  from @dra27.  This means that all the supported OCaml compilers
  for Dune will be present in a single container.
* Add support for 4.09 now that 4.08 has branched.
* Use `+trunk` in the suffix for opam dev version packages.
* Add `Releases.is_dev` to make it easier to spot a dev release.

## v1.0.0

* Add ARM32 (aarch32, arm32v7) architecture.
* Add more OCaml 4.07.[0,1] functions and mark it as latest stable.
* Port to Dune from Jbuilder.
* Add several modules related to compiler configuration, in order
  to faciliate mechanical generation of opam2 compiler packages.
* Drop support for opam 1.2.x in favour of opam 2.0.0.
* Update opam metadata to 2.0 format.

## v0.4.0

* Add metadata for OCaml 4.08 development.
* Add an Opam.V2 module for opam 2.0 package names for compilers.
