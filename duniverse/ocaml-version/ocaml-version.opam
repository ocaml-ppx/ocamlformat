synopsis: "Manipulate, parse and generate OCaml compiler version strings"
description: """
This library provides facilities to parse version numbers of the OCaml
compiler, and enumerates the various official OCaml releases and configuration
variants.

OCaml version numbers are of the form `major.minor.patch+extra`, where the
`patch` and `extra` fields are optional.  This library offers the following
functionality:

- Functions to parse and serialise OCaml compiler version numbers.
- Enumeration of official OCaml compiler version releases.
- Test compiler versions for a particular feature (e.g. the `bytes` type)
- [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) compiler switch enumeration.
