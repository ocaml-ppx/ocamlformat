(** Manipulate, parse and generate OCaml version strings.

    These are of the form [major.minor.patch+extra], where the
    [patch] and [extra] fields are optional.  *)

type t
(** Type of an OCaml version string *)

val v : ?patch:int -> ?extra:string -> int -> int -> t
(** [v ?patch ?extra major minor] will construct an OCaml
    version string with the appropriate parameters.  The
    [patch] and [extra] indicators are optional, but it is
    conventional to include a [patch] value of 0 for most
    recent OCaml releases. *)

(** {2 Parsers and serializers} *)

val to_string : ?sep:char -> t -> string
(** [to_string ?sep t] will convert the version [t] into
    a human-readable representation.  The [sep] will default
    to [+] which is the normal representation of extra
    version strings, but can be changed to another character
    by supplying [sep].  One such usecase is to generate
    Docker container tags from OCaml version strings, where
    only dashes and alphanumeric characters are allowed. *)

val of_string : string -> (t, [> `Msg of string ]) result
(** [of_string t] will parse the version string in [t].
    The return value is compatible with the {!Result}
    combinators defined in the [rresult] library. *)

val of_string_exn : string -> t
(** [of_string_exn t] behaves as {!of_string} but raises
    [Invalid_argument] if the string cannot be parsed. *)

val equal : t -> t -> bool
(** [equal a b] is the equality function for two OCaml
    version strings. Returns [true] if they are equal,
    [false] if they are not. *)

val compare : t -> t -> int
(** [compare a b] is the comparison function for two OCaml
    version strings. Returns [-1] if [a<b], [0] if they are
    equal and [1] if [a>b]. Comparison is done using integer
    comparison for the major, minor and patch versions, and
    lexical comparison for any extra version strings present. *)

val pp : Format.formatter -> t -> unit [@@ocaml.toplevel_printer]
(** [pp fmt t] will output a human-readable version string of
    [t] to the [fmt] formatter. *)

(** {2 Architecture Support }
    These definitions cover the CPU architectures that OCaml
    runs and is supported on. *)

type arch = [ `I386 | `X86_64 | `Aarch64 | `Aarch32 | `Ppc64le ]
(** Type of CPU architectures.
    TODO: This is currently an incomplete list, and lists just
    those used by the opam test systems. Contributions welcome
    to complete it. *)

val arches : arch list
(** [arches] is an enumeration of all of the possible {!arch} values. *)

val string_of_arch : arch -> string
(** [string_of_arch arch] will convert [arch] into a human-readable
    CPU architecture string.  The result will follow the
    {{:https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment}GOARCH}
    convention used by Golang. *)

val arch_of_string : string -> (arch, [> `Msg of string ]) result
(** [arch_of_string t] will parse the architecture string in [t].
    The return value is compatible with the {!Result}
    combinators defined in the [rresult] library. This function
    is liberal and will attempt to understand variants of the
    same architecture.  For example, both [aarch64] and [arm64]
    are parsed into {!`Aarch64}. *)

val arch_of_string_exn: string -> arch
(** [arch_of_string_exn t] is the same as {!arch_of_string},
    except that it raises [Invalid_argument] in case of error. *)

val arch_is_32bit: arch -> bool
(** [arch_is_32bit t] will return [true] if the architecture has
     a 32-bit wordsize. *)

val to_opam_arch : arch -> string
(** [to_opam_arch arch] will return a string that is compatible
    with opam's [%{arch}%] variable. *)

val of_opam_arch : string -> arch option
(** [of_opam_arch s] will try to convert [s] that represents an
    opam [%{arch}%] variable to an {!arch} value. *)

val to_docker_arch : arch -> string
(** [to_docker_arch arch] will return a string that is compatible
    with a Docker multiarch property.  This can be used in
    [--platform] flags to [docker run], for example. *)

val of_docker_arch : string -> arch option
(** [of_docker_arch s] will try to convert [s] that represents
    a Docker multiarch variable to an {!arch} value. *)

(** {2 Accessors} *)

val major : t -> int
(** [major t] will return the major version number of an OCaml
    release.  For example, [of_string "4.03.0" |> major] will
    return [4]. *)

val minor : t -> int
(** [minor t] will return the minor version number of an OCaml
    release.  For example, [of_string "4.03.0" |> minor] will
    return [3]. *)

val patch : t -> int option
(** [patch t] will return the patch version number of an OCaml
    release.  For example, [of_string "4.03.0" |> minor] will
    return [Some 0]. *)

val extra : t -> string option
(** [extra t] will return the additional information string of
    an OCaml release.
    For example, [of_string "4.03.0+flambda" |> extra] will
    return [Some "flambda"]. *)

val with_variant : t -> string option -> t
(** [with_variant t extra] will return a fresh value with
    the extra version information in [t] to
    [extra], and remove it if [None] is supplied. *)

val without_variant : t -> t
(** [without_variant t] is {!with_variant} [t None]. It removes
    any extra version information from the version string [t]. *)

val with_patch : t -> int option -> t
(** [with_patch t patch] will return a fresh value with
    the patch number in [t] to [patch], and remove it if [None]
    is supplied. *)

val without_patch : t -> t
(** [without_patch t] is as {!with_patch} [t None]. It removes
    the least significant number from the version string.
    This is useful for the Docker OCaml containers, which are
    all named without a patch number and compiled using the
    latest patch release (e.g. [4.06] instead of [4.06.1]). *)

val with_just_major_and_minor : t -> t
(** [with_just_major_and_minor t] strips out any patch and
    extra version information to return the X.Y form of the
    OCaml release. For example, [4.08.0+trunk+flambda] will
    return the version representing [4.08]. *)

(** {2 Constants } *)

val sys_version : t
(** [sys_version] is the version of OCaml that this library is
    currently compiled with, which will be the same as
    {!Sys.ocaml_version}. *)

(** Values representing official releases of OCaml. *)
