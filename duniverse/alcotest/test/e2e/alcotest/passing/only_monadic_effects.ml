(** Ensures that {!Alcotest.run} does not print when evaluated at monadic type
    (until the resulting computation is explicitly run). We require that effects
    introduced by tests (whether during evaluation {i or} during running the
    computation) are not partially observable during application of
    {!Alcotest.run}. This is because such behaviour could be relied upon as part
    of the public API, when in fact it is dependent on internal implementation
    details.

    This is tested by building a runner over the [Terminal] monad, which reduces
    to [()] immediately on evaluation and so discovers any effects in the
    evaluation of the bottom-most value in the computation.

    This is a regression test for a bug in which test effects were partially
    observable during evaluation of the computation. See
    https://github.com/mirage/alcotest/pull/228 for more details. *)
