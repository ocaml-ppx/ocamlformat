(** Unicode text segmentation on UTF-X OCaml strings.

    {!Uuseg} helper functions acting directly on UTF-X encoded OCaml
    strings.

    {b Warning.} All these functions silently replace malformed encoded Unicode
    data by a {!Stdlib.Uchar.rep} character.

    {e Unicode version %%UNICODE_VERSION%%} *)

(** {1:segment Segment} *)

type 'a folder = 'a -> string -> 'a
(** The type for segment folders. The function takes an accumulator
    and a segment. Segments are the UTF-X encoded characters delimited
    by two [`Boundary] occurences. If the segmenter has no initial or
    final [`Boundary], the folding function inserts an implicit
    one. Empty segments – which by definition do not happen with
    the default segmenters – are not reported. *)

val fold_utf_8 : [< Uuseg.boundary] -> 'a folder -> 'a -> string -> 'a
(** [fold_utf_8 b f acc s] folds over the [b] UTF-8 encoded segments of
    the UTF-8 encoded string [s] using [f] and [acc]. *)

val fold_utf_16be : [< Uuseg.boundary] -> 'a folder -> 'a -> string -> 'a
(** [fold_utf16be] is like {!fold_utf_8} but on UTF-16BE encoded strings. *)

val fold_utf_16le : [< Uuseg.boundary] -> 'a folder -> 'a -> string -> 'a
(** [fold_utf16le] is like {!fold_utf_8} but on UTF-16BE encoded
    strings. *)

(** {1:pp Pretty-printers}

    Using OCaml's {!Format.pp_print_string} with Unicode encoded
    strings will most of the time derail the pretty-printing process
    for two reasons. First the Unicode encoding of a character may
    span more than one byte and [pp_print_string] considers one
    character to be one byte. Second there may be a discrepancy
    between the sequence of user-perceived characters (grapheme
    clusters e.g. é) and the actual sequences of Unicode characters in
    the data (e.g. é represented by the decomposition e + ´,
    <U+0065,U+0301>).

    The following formatters fix these problems for many (but not all)
    scripts. *)

val pp_utf_8 : Format.formatter -> string -> unit
(** [pp_utf8 ppf s] prints the UTF-8 encoded string [s]. Each grapheme
    cluster is considered as taking a length of 1. *)

val pp_utf_8_text : Format.formatter -> string -> unit
(** [pp_utf_8_text ppf s] prints the UTF-8 encoded string [s]. Each
    grapheme cluster is considered as taking a length of 1. Each
    line break opportunity is hinted with {!Format.pp_print_break}
    and mandatory line breaks issue a {!Format.pp_force_newline} call.

    Take into account the following points:
    {ul
    {- Any {{!Uucp.White.is_white_space}white space} Unicode character
       occuring before a break opportunity will be translated to a space
       (U+0020) in output if no break occurs.}
    {- The sequence CR LF (U+000D, U+000A) and all kind of mandatory
       line breaks are translated to whathever line separator is output
       by {!Format.pp_force_newline}. See {!pp_utf_8_lines} for the
       list of characters treated as mandatory line breaks.}
    {- Soft hyphens are handled but due to limitations in {!Format} are
       not replaced by hard ones on breaks.}} *)

val pp_utf_8_lines : Format.formatter -> string -> unit
(** [pp_utf_8_lines ppf s] prints the UTF-8 encoded string [s]. Each
    grapheme cluster is considered as taking a length of 1. Each
    mandatory line break (including the sequence CR LF (U+000D,
    U+000A)) issues a {!Format.pp_force_newline} and is translated to
    whathever line separator this function outputs.

    This function correctly handles all kinds of line ends present
    Unicode, as of 7.0.0 this is FORM FEED (U+000C), LINE TABULATION
    (U+000B), LINE SEPARATOR (U+2028), PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR (U+2020),
    NEXT LINE (U+085), LINE FEED (U+000A), CARRIAGE RETURN (U+000D),
    and the sequence CR LF (U+000D, U+000A). *)
