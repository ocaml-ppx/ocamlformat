ocamlfind-mini
----------------------------------------------------------------------

ocamlfind-mini is an O'Caml script that implements a subset of the
full functionality of ocamlfind. It consists only of one file, so it
is easy to distribute it with any software.

The subset is normally sufficient to compile a library and to
install the library; but it is insufficient to link the library
into an executable. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For Unixes, the script runs out of the box. It uses the ocaml system
found in the command path.

I think the script also runs in Windows, but I have not yet checked that.
Anyway, you cannot call it directly, but by doing
ocaml ocamlfind-mini <args>...

Macintosh is not supported; I don't have enough knowledge for a Mac port.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONALITY:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall: The configuration file ocamlfind.conf is ignored. However,
some environment variables are respected (see below). 

A package directory is recognized by checking whether there is a META
file in it. However, the contents of that file are ignored.

The following subset has been implemented:

- ocamlfind-mini [ocamlc|ocamlopt|ocamlcp|ocamlmktop] <args>...

  The -package option works, but you must set the environment variable
  OCAMLPATH (see below).

  The options -linkpkg, -predicates, -dontlink, -syntax, -ppopt are
  rejected.

  This normally means that you can compile modules as in:

      ocamlfind-mini ocamlc -c -package p1,p2,p3 my_module.ml

  However, you cannot create executables because -linkpkg is not
  supported.

  Note that ocamlfind-mini is unable to figure out the prerequisite
  packages, so the -package option must enumerate _all_ needed packages.
  
  Note that ocamlfind-mini does not support the alternate directory
  layout where all META files are collected in one directory.

- ocamlfind-mini install <pkg> <file>...

  Installs the files in the package directory for <pkg>. You must help
  ocamlfind-mini by specifying the destination directory:

  * Setting the -destdir option:

    ocamlfind-mini install -destdir <dir> <pkg> <file> ...

    This command installs the new package into <dir>/<pkg>.

  * Setting the OCAMLFIND_DESTDIR variable:

    export OCAMLFIND_DESTDIR=<dir>
    ocamlfind-mini install <pkg> <file> ...

    This command installs the new package into <dir>/<pkg>, too.

- ocamlfind-mini remove <pkg>

  Removes the package <pkg>. Again, you must specify the destination
  directory by either setting the -destdir option or by setting the
  OCAMLFIND_DESTDIR variable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ENVIRONMENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following variables are supported:

- OCAMLPATH

  A colon (Win: semicolon)-separated list of directories:
  OCAMLPATH=<dir1>:<dir2>:...

  When ocamlfind-mini searches a package <pkg>, it checks whether
  <dirK>/<pkg>/META exists for K=1, 2, ...

- OCAMLFIND_DESTDIR

  The destination directory for "install" and "remove".

- OCAMLFIND_METADIR

  The destination directory for META files. It is not recommended to set
  this variable.
