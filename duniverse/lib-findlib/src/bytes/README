backward-compatibility package for the standard Bytes module of 4.02

Starting from 4.02, the OCaml standard library splits String into two
modules, String for now-immutable strings and Bytes for mutable byte
sequences. This package exports a Bytes package mimicking the new
interface to older OCaml version, letting you write code using Bytes
that works with OCaml < 4.02.
