<abstract>
<para>
The "findlib" library provides a scheme to manage reusable software
components (packages), and includes tools that support this
scheme. Packages are collections of OCaml modules for which
metainformation can be stored. The packages are kept in the filesystem
hierarchy, but with strict directory structure. The library contains
functions to look the directory up that stores a package, to query
metainformation about a package, and to retrieve dependency
information about multiple packages. There is also a tool that allows
the user to enter queries on the command-line. In order to simplify
compilation and linkage, there are new frontends of the various OCaml
compilers that can directly deal with packages.
</para>

<para>
Together with the packages metainformation is stored. This includes a
version string, the archives the package consists of, and additional
linker options. Packages can also be dependent on other
packages. There is a query which finds out all predecessors of a list
of packages and sorts them topologically. The new compiler frontends
do this implicitly.
</para>

<para>
Metainformation can be conditional, i.e. depend on a set of
predicates. This is mainly used to be able to react on certain
properties of the environment, such as if the bytecode or the native
compiler is invoked, if the application is multi-threaded, and a few
more. If the new compiler frontends are used, most predicates are
found out automatically.
</para>

<para>
There is special support for scripts. A new directive, "#require",
loads packages into scripts.

<title>Libraries and Packages</title>

<para> Reusability is one of the keywords in software engineering
today. It simply means to have source code that can be shared by
several programs. Usually, modules are combined to libraries, and the
library archive files can be linked into programs. As the idea might
be simple, its practical implementation is complex because sharing of
source code has an impact on all steps and phases in software
production. This document only addresses the following administrative
problems:
</para>

<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
<listitem>
<para>
Storing the libraries in file hierarchies
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>

</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Objective Caml has a variety of language means to support
reusability. Most important, polymorphic functions can be written
which generalize the types of input arguments and the
type of the result value. There are many examples in the core library
such that I assume that the reader is familiar with this
feature. Second, modules and functors must be mentioned which not only
generalize types of values, but can even generalize structures,
i.e. types with associated operations. Third, the class construct
allows us to adopt the object-oriented techniques of abstraction such
as inheritage and dynamic method lookup.
</para>

<para>
In the following, we are only analyzing the problem of making and
using libraries from a purely software-technical point of view. This
means, we ignore how to make functions polymorphic, and how to create
functors and classes. Instead, we only look at how to invoke the
O'Caml compiler to create, manage, and use libraries. Especially, we
are interested in the administration of systems of libraries that
have dependencies.</para>

<para>
One of the complex operations on such a system is the replacement of 
a library by a newer version. Because of the strict compatibility
checks of O'Caml, it is usually necessary to rebuild and reinstall
all dependent libraries as well. With the help of findlib, one can
find out which are the dependent libraries. (However, findlib does
not provide a framework to rebuild them. For example, the GODI
system includes such a framework.)
</para>

<para>
The library is also called a "package" when it is seen as a removeable
and replaceable set of files. Findlib requires that there is a 
certain directory structure; it is not possible to install the files
at arbitrary places (findlib does not even maintain a file list).
For simplicity, every library is usually stored into its own
directory, i.e. the library archive files and the interface files.
</para>

<para>From the perspective of the compiler, the library is made
accessible by adding the package directory to the search path
of the compiler. By doing so, the modules of the library are
added to the namespace universe, and thus can be opened by 
modules using them. This means that the approach "one package
= one directory" can be naturally translated into language
operations modifying the namespace scope.</para>

<para>
When linking a program, it must be specified which link operation is
necessary to use a certain library. Often, only a single archive file
needs to be linked in, but sometimes additional archives or system
libraries must be linked, too. Furthermore, the link operations
often depends on certain conditions, e.g. whether a single- or
multi-threaded program is being created.
</para>

<para>
The <emphasis>findlib</emphasis> library is my suggestion for a
package manager suitable for Objective Caml. It is a library (stored
as a package itself) which can answer the following questions:
</para>

<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
<listitem>
<para>If I want to use a package, which is the directory containing
the compiled interfaces and implementations? - The package directory
may vary from system to system, and this feature makes it easier to
write Makefiles that run everywhere. Furthermore, OCaml can load
modules dynamically, and it is not a good practice to compile in the
location of such modules. The better way is to ask findlib where the
module resides today.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Which other packages must be linked in, too, if I want to use a
certain package?
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>Which archives need to be linked in, and which compiler options
are necessary?
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>If there is a version of the archive with additional properties,
which file should I use? - Additional properties are at least:
Thread-safety, using POSIX threads, and being gprof-enabled. It is
simple to add more criterions.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>


<para>
Furthermore, there is a frontend for this library called
<emphasis>ocamlfind</emphasis>. It is a command-line interface for the
library, but has also some additional abilities:
</para>


<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
<listitem>
<para>It can invoke ocamlc, ocamlopt, ocamlmktop, and ocamlcp such
that compiler arguments necessary to use a package or link it in are
automatically added.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>It can install and uninstall packages.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>It can find out dependent packages.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
As you'll see in the following chapters, the usage of this library is
really simple. If you want only to link in packages written by other
people, you must only change the command that invokes the compiler,
e.g. instead of calling "ocamlc program.ml" invoke "ocamlfind ocamlc
-package name_of_package_to_use -linkpkg program.ml", and you can
refer to the named package within program.ml. If you want to turn your
collection of modules into a package, you need only to write one
adminstrative file (META) containing all extra information such as
required other packages.
</para>


</chapter>

<!-- ********************************************************************** -->

<chapter>
<title>Using packages</title>

<sect1>
<title>Listing the installed packages</title>

<para>
You can list which packages are installed by executing

<programlisting>
ocamlfind list
</programlisting>

You will get a list of names and version numbers. You can get a bit
more information by passing the -describe option:

<programlisting>
ocamlfind list -describe
</programlisting>
</para>
</sect1>


<sect1>
<title>Looking up package directories</title>

<para>
The package manager knows the preferred location for packages (this
location is compiled in), which is usually
/usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib. You can ask the package manager where
package p is stored by simply typing
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind query p
</programlisting>

<para>
and it will answer something like
</para>

<programlisting>
/usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/p
</programlisting>

<para>
There is an environment variable OCAMLPATH which can specify further
directories where packages are stored. (The search order is: first
the directories in OCAMLPATH in turn, then the default path
set in ocamlfind.conf)
</para>

<para>
Historically, this kind of query was the first and only way of using
ocamlfind, and because of the similiarity to the Unix find command it
got its name. Finding out package locations is a basic but
nethertheless important feature because it hides the details of the
filesystem hierarchy. It is sufficient only to know the name of the
package, and if needed, you can use the lookup mechanism implemented
in ocamlfind to get the concrete directory.
</para>
</sect1>


<sect1>
<title>How a package directory looks like</title>

<para>
Let us assume that the package p implements the modules M1 and M2. If
you compile m1.mli and m2.mli you get the corresponding binary files
m1.cmi and m2.cmi describing the interfaces of the modules. Of course,
these cmi files must go into the package directory. It is recommended
to put the source mli files into the directory, too, as they document
the interface.
</para>

<para>
Another product of the compilation are two cmo files, m1.cmo and
m2.cmo (we assume the bytecode compiler, the native compiler would
create m1.cmx and m2.cmx). It is possible to put these files directly
into the directory, but there is a better way. As it makes only sense
to use both modules (a very common assumption), they should first be
archived by doing
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlc -a -o p.cma m1.cmo m2.cmo
</programlisting>

<para>
The archive p.cma contains both cmo files, and preserves the order of
the files. Assumed that in M2 there is a reference to an entity in M1,
M2 depends on M1 and when linking a program using these modules, M1
must be mentioned first (e.g. ocamlc m1.cmo m2.cmo
program.ml)<footnote><para>Note that C linkers usually require the reverse
order, but only for archive elements, i.e. files with suffix
.a.</para></footnote>. If you create the archive p.cma it contains already
this dependency, and you need not to remember it when linking in the
p.cma.
</para>

<para>
So far the files m1.cmi, m2.cmi, and p.cma are needed, and m1.mli and
m2.mli are recommended. Usually there is another file in the
directory, META, containing additional information about the package.
In our example, META looks like
</para>

<programlisting>
description = "Our super-duper package"
requires = ""
version = "1"
archive(byte) = "p.cma"
</programlisting>

<para>The variable "requires" contains a list of packages that are
required by this package (the names may be separated by commas or
spaces). As our package, p, does not depend on any other package, this
list is empty. I'll explain what happens with non-empty lists below.
</para>

<para>
The variable "version" is simply a version string, and "description"
is a short comment on the package.
</para>

<para>The variable "archive" denotes the files that have to be
actually linked in if the package is used. This is again a list of
(file) names. In contrast to the other variables, "archive" has a
condition, written in parantheses. This value of "archive" will only
be used if the predicate "byte" is true; this predicate is usually
given if the program is compiled to bytecode. If you have a native
archive, p.cmxa, of the two modules M1 and M2, you can add another
line to META:
</para>

<programlisting>
archive(native) = "p.cmxa"
</programlisting>

<para>
The correct value for the "archive" variable is selected upon the
given set of predicates.
</para>

<para>Many packages can also be loaded at runtime with the
<literal>Fl_dynload</literal> module. In this case, though, the
variable "plugin" is used instead of "archive", e.g.</para>

<programlisting>
plugin(byte) = "p.cma"
plugin(native) = "p.cmxs"
</programlisting>

<para>(You can create p.cmxs from p.cmxa with 
"ocamlopt -shared -linkall -o p.cmxs p.cmxa".) Note that "plugin" is entirely optional.
</sect1>


<sect1>
<title>Querying information stored in META files</title>

<para>
By setting some options of ocamlfind you can query the variables from
the META files. For example, -long-format (or short -l) selects all
interesting variables:
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind query -long-format p
</programlisting>

<para>
This would answer something like:
</para>

<programlisting>
package:     p
description: Our super-duper package
version:     1
archive(s):
linkopts:
location:    /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/p
</programlisting>

<para>
The values of the "archive" variable are missing because no predicate
has been set, without further options "ocamlfind query" operates with
an empty set of predicates. To get the bytecode archive, run:
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind query -long-format -predicates byte p
</programlisting>

<para>
You can set more than one predicate. It usually does not make sense, but
you could for example select both bytecode and native archives by:
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind query -long-format -predicates byte,native p
</programlisting>

<para>
As both settings for "archive" are now equally like, the extraction
mechnism chooses simply the first. The general rule is that the first
most special value is selected.
</para>
</sect1>


<sect1>
<title>How to compile and link a program that uses a package</title>

<para>
Now suppose you want to compile a program which calls functions of
your new package p. If prog1.ml, prog2.ml, and prog3.ml are the three
source files the program consists of, compile them with the commands
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -package p -c prog1.ml
ocamlfind ocamlc -package p -c prog2.ml
ocamlfind ocamlc -package p -c prog3.ml
</programlisting>

<para>
The "ocamlfind ocamlc" invocation is a frontend to "ocamlc". Most
arguments are directly passed to "ocamlc", but there are a few new
options, and often some new options are implicitly added. Here, the
new -package option is used, which adds search paths such that the
modules of package p are found. Effectively, the following direct
ocamlc invocations would be equivalent
<footnote><para>If you specify the -verbose option, the constructed
command is printed to the terminal. Actually, there are some more
implicitly added options, especially -ccopt -I&lt;dir&gt; for every
package directory &lt;dir&gt;. This means that you can compile C
programs accessing header files stored in the package directory.
</para></footnote>:
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlc -I /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/p -c prog1.ml
ocamlc -I /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/p -c prog2.ml
ocamlc -I /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/p -c prog3.ml
</programlisting>

<para>
The -I option has the effect that the named directory is also searched
when looking up cmi files. Because of this you can refer directly to
the modules M1 and M2 in the program sources.
</para>

<para>
In order to link the program use the following command:
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -o program -package p -linkpkg prog1.cmo prog2.cmo prog3.cmo
</programlisting>

<para>
The -linkpkg option causes some more arguments to be added to the
constructed ocamlc command. Especially, the name of the archive of p
is extracted from the META file, and automatically inserted before the
prog1.cmo argument. The resulting command looks like<footnote>
<para>Again, the actual command contains even some more arguments...
</para></footnote>:
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlc -o program -I /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/p p.cma prog1.cmo prog2.cmo prog3.cmo
</programlisting>

<para>
Please note that the bytecode archive p.cma has been selected, and not
the native archive p.cmxa. As it is known that the bytecode compiler
is used, the predicate "byte" is automatically set.
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1>
<title>Dependencies</title>

<para>
Often packages use other packages themselves. Let q be another package
consisting of the single module M3 which contains references to M1 and
M2. At the first glance, we can ignore this when describing the
package, as we could always add "-package p" and "-package q" options
when compiling programs using q. This solution is not optimal, as the
user of a package must have knowlege about details of the package that
should normally be hidden. When we introduced the notion of packages,
one of the most important properties was that we can replace packages
by improved versions. Imagine that q is replaced by q', but q' uses
not only p but also r. Every program that used q and is now forced to
use q' must be changed (at least in the Makefile) in order to link r,
too. This is clearly not what is intended by packages.
</para>

<para>
The far better solution is to store dependency information in the META
files. The "requires" variable can list names of packages that are
direct ancestors, i.e. referred directly. (Do not put indirect
ancestors into this variable, for example further packages required by
r when describing q - these are found out automatically.) The META
file of q looks like:
</para>

<programlisting>
description = "Something that needs p"
requires = "p"
version = "1"
archive(byte) = q.cma
archive(native) = q.cmxa
</programlisting>

<para>
If you want to put several package names into "requires", separate
them with commas or spaces.
</para>

<para>
The "ocamlfind query" command ignores the "requires" value by default,
you must add the -recursive option. In this case, all direct or
indirect ancestors of the packages given on the command line are
selected, too, and printed in topological order. For example, the
command
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind query -recursive -long-format -predicate byte q
</programlisting>

<para>
prints two records:
</para>

<programlisting>
package:     p
description: Our super-duper package
version:     1
archive(s):  p.cma
linkopts:
location:    /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/p

package:     q
description: Something that needs p
version:     1
archive(s):  q.cma
linkopts:
location:    /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/p
</programlisting>

<para>
Without -recursive, only q would have been printed.
</para>

<para>
The compiler frontend provided with ocamlfind always works
recursively. In order to compile and link another.ml that uses q, the
following command is sufficient:
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -o another -package q -linkpkg another.ml
</programlisting>

<para>
It is not necessary to specify -package p in this statement as the
dependency relation is always used to find out the actually meant
set of packages.
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1>
<title>Linker options</title>

<para>
<emphasis>
Beginning with OCaml 3.00, the compiler itself has an interesting feature
called "automatic linking" that makes the following mechanism superflous in
most cases. Automatic linking means that it is possible to store the linker
options into the cma or cmxa file such that the compiler itself knows which
options are necessary. Of course, the following mechanism still works, and it
is still helpful when conditional linking is required.
</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
OCaml has a C interface which means that C libraries can be linked in
and C functions can be declared as new language primitives. Using such
libraries requires special linker options. Some of the core libraries
distributed with OCaml are partly implemented in C and thus additional
libraries must be specified in the linking phase of the program.
</para>

<para>
For example, the "str" library providing regular expressions requires
to be linked as follows:
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlc -o prog str.cma my_file1.cmo my_file2.cmo -cclib -lstr
</programlisting>

<para>
The -cclib option passes the following argument directly to the
underlying C linker which has the effect that libstr.a is linked in,
too. The "-cclib -lstr" is directly associated with str.cma as the
latter simply cannot be used without the former. Assume you would
write a META file describing str. That "str.cma" should be linked in
as archive is clear; the "-cclib -lstr" can be specified in another
variable called "linkopts". The META file would look like:
</para>

<programlisting>
requires = ""
version = "str from ocaml 2.02"
archive(byte) = "str.cma"
archive(native) = "str.cmxa"
linkopts = "-cclib -lstr"
</programlisting>

<para>
This has the effect that specifying -linkpkg in one of the compiler
frontends not only chooses one of the archive files, but also extracts
the necessary linker options from the META file. The above example can
also be compiled with:
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -o prog -package str -linkpkg my_file1.cmo my_file2.cmo
</programlisting>

<para>
Most people will never write META files with "linkopts" settings. But
this feature is very useful at least for the core libraries such as
str. Because of this, the "findlib" distribution comes with META files
for the core libraries in order to hide the linker options. This
means that you can already use the packages "str", "dbm", "dynlink",
"graphics", "num", "threads", "unix", and "camltk", and that the
appropriate archives and linker options are automatically extracted.
</para>

</sect1>

</chapter>

<!-- ********************************************************************** -->

<chapter>
<title>Dependency analysis of packages</title>

<sect1>
<title>Querying ancestors</title>

<para>
Every package denotes in its META file only the list of direct
ancestors. The theoretical model of the dependency relation is a
directed acyclic graph (DAG), with the packages as vertices and edges
from packages to their direct ancestors. The graph must be acyclic
because OCaml does not allow cyclic dependencies between modules.
</para>

<para>
What happens if you query something like
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind query -recursive p1 p2 ... pN
</programlisting>

<para>
is that the named packages p1 to pN are marked in the graph, and that
repeatedly all direct ancestors of marked packages are marked, too,
until there is not any marked package remaining with an unmarked
ancestor. All marked packages are then printed in topological
order. This simply means that for the printed packages p1 to pM holds
that if pI is printed before pJ then pI is a (possibly indirect)
ancestor of pJ.
</para>

<para>
The topological order plays a role when the link command is
constructed by "ocamlfind ocamlc", as Ocaml requires that archives
must be linked in topological order. For example, the link statement
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -o another -package q -linkpkg another.ml
</programlisting>

<para>
must be turned into the effective command
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlc -o another [...more options...] p.cma q.cma another.ml
</programlisting>

<para>
and <emphasis>not</emphasis>
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlc -o another [...more options...] q.cma p.cma another.ml
</programlisting>

<para>
because there are references from q.cma to p.cma.
</para>

<para>
In C, there is a similar requirement when linking static archives. The
linker backend ld wants the archives in <emphasis>reversed</emphasis>
topological order, i.e. the deepest ancestor must come last in the
list of linked archives. Because of this, the additional linker
options specified in the "linkopts" variable are passed in reversed
order to the underlying linker. This means that you can refer to C
libraries of ancestor packages of p in C libraries provided in p.
</para>

<para>
Note that most operating systems do not require any specific order for
dynamically linked C libraries (the exception is, surprise!, AIX).
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1>
<title>Querying descendants</title>

<para>
It is often useful to find out the descendants of a package, i.e. all
direct or indirect users of the package. There is another "ocamlfind"
subcommand that allows us to query descendants. For example, to get
the direct and indirect users of p, type in
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind query -descendants p
</programlisting>

<para>
The set of packages that are possible descendants is determined as
follows:

<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
<listitem>
<para>
All packages located in directories mentioned in the environment
variable OCAMLPATH are candidates. Note that only package directories
containing META files are taken.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The packages in the default package directory are candidates, too.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>

<title>Compiling and linking</title>

<para>
There are compiler frontends for the four compilers ocamlc, ocamlopt,
ocamlmktop, and ocamlcp. They are simply called by specifying the name
of the compiler as first argument to ocamlfind, i.e.
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc ...arguments...
ocamlfind ocamlopt ...arguments...
ocamlfind ocamlmktop ...arguments...
ocamlfind ocamlcp ...arguments...
</programlisting>

<para>
In addition to the compiler options handled by the compilers
themselves, the following options are available:
</para>

<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
<listitem>
<para>
-package &lt;name&gt;: Causes that the package &lt;name&gt is added to
the package list, and that -I options are added for every package, and
all direct or indirect ancestors.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
-linkpkg: Causes that the archives of the packages in the package list
and all their direct or indirect ancestors are added in topological
order to the command line before the first file to compile or to
link. Packages specified by -dontlink are not linked in, though.
Furthermore, the linker options of these packages are added in
reverse topological order at the end of the command line.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
-predicates &lt;predicate-list&gt;: The named predicates are included
in the list of predicates. Note that there are some predicates set by
default, see below.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
-dontlink &lt;name&gt;: Specifies that the package &lt;name&gt; and
all its direct or indirect ancestors should not be linked in.
</para>
</listitem>


<listitem>
<para>
-passopt &lt;opt&gt;: The option &lt;opt&gt; is passed directly to the
underlying compiler. This is especially needed to pass undocumented
options to the compiler.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
If you only want to compile, i.e. the -c option is in effect, you
normally only need the -package option.
</para>

<para>
Depending on the compiler and on the given options, some predicates
are set by default:
</para>

<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
<listitem>
<para>
byte: The predicate "byte" is set when ocamlc, ocamlcp, or ocamlmktop
is used to compile or link.
</para>

<para>
native: The predicate "native" is set when ocamlopt is used to compile
or to link.

<title>Toploops and runtime systems</title>

<sect2>
<title>Dynamic toploops</title>

<para>
Recent versions of O'Caml support dynamic loading of stub libraries
(but only for the more widely used operating systems). This means
that one can start a toploop by running

<programlisting>
$ ocaml
        Objective Caml version 3.07+2
 
# _
</programlisting>

and that it is now possible to load .cma archive files referring to
shared C libraries ("DLLs"). In older versions of O'Caml this was
not possible and one had to create a so-called custom toploop
with the ocamlmktop command. This method is still supported and 
explained below; however, nowadays it is often not necessary to
do so. For the modern way, findlib includes a small script called
"topfind" (i.e. "ocamlfind for the toploop") that can be directly
loaded into the toploop:

<programlisting>
# #use "topfind";;
- : unit = ()
Findlib has been successfully loaded. Additional directives:
  #require "package";;      to load a package
  #list;;                   to list the available packages
  #camlp4o;;                to load camlp4 (standard syntax)
  #camlp4r;;                to load camlp4 (revised syntax)
  #predicates "p,q,...";;   to set these predicates
  Topfind.reset();;         to force that packages will be reloaded
  #thread;;                 to enable threads
 
- : unit = ()
# _
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
A number of additional directives are now available. The "#require"
directive loads additional packages (with all dependencies):
</para>

<programlisting>
# #require "q1,q2,...,qM";;
</programlisting>

<para>
"#require" loads the listed packages and all their ancestors in the
right order, but leaves packages out that have already been loaded.
Scripts can now simply load and document which packages are used by a
"#require" directive right at the beginning of the script.
</para>

<para>
The #list directive lists the available packages as "ocamlfind list"
would do it.</para>

<para>
If you need additional predicates, you can set them with #predicates.
Note that this should be done before the first package is loaded in
order to ensure a consistent library system.</para>

<para>
The #thread directive enables multi-threading if possible. Note that
this is only supported for installations basing on the POSIX thread
library. (However, if you have only have VM threads, you can still
create a custom toploop supporting threads. See below.) Furthermore,
the #thread directive should be executed before any packages are
loaded.
</para>

<para>
The #camlp4o and #camlp4r directives load the camlp4 syntax parsers
for the standard and the revised syntax, respectively.
</para>

<para>
Especially when developing packages, it is sometimes necessary to
reload all dynamically loaded packages in the toploop. This can be
forced by
</para>

<programlisting>
Topfind.reset();;
</programlisting>

<para>
which causes the "#require" directive to load all packages again. The
Topfind module implements all the mentioned directives.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Custom toploops</title>

<para>
It is very simple to create toploops. In order to make a toploop
executable that includes directly the packages p1,p2,..,pN simply
execute the command
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlmktop -o toploop -package p1,p2,...,pN,findlib -linkpkg
</programlisting>

<para>
(Maybe you have to add the -custom switch.) Note that one of the 
packages should be "findlib" itself, because this adds the 
additional directives mentioned above, i.e. you can directly use
these directives without #use "topfind" (but running "topfind" 
is harmless).
</para>

<para>
Note that such a toploop includes the code of the packages given
on the commmand line, but that it does not automatically add the
package directories to the search path (in previous versions of
findlib this was tried, but it never really worked). To do so,
you still have to #require the packages.
</para>

<para>
In order to create a toploop supporting VM-style threads, use the
command

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlmktop -o toploop -package p1,p2,...,pN,findlib,threads -vmthread -linkpkg
</programlisting>

Now the #thread directive will work and enable the access to the
multi-threading modules.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Runtime systems</title>

<para>
Building of runtime systems is supported, too. For example, you can run
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -o runtime -make-runtime -package p1,p2,...,pN -linkpkg
</programlisting>

<para>
but the problem is which options to specify when a program is linked
for this runtime system. If you executed
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -o program -use-runtime runtime -package p1,p2,...,pN\
          -linkpkg m1.cmo ... mM.cmo
</programlisting>

<para>
it would be tried to link the archives from the packages again into
the bytecode binary. Because of this, it is necessary to suppress
linking in packages of the runtime system when linking binaries for a
runtime system. The -dontlink option can be used for this:
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -o program -use-runtime runtime -package p1,p2,...,pN\
          -dontlink p1,p2,...,pN -linkpkg m1.cmo ... mM.cmo
</programlisting>

<para>
Note that the -package option can enumerate more packages than
-dontlink, and in this case the additional packages are actually
linked in as they are not contained in the runtime system.
</para>
</sect2>

</sect1>


<sect1>
<title>Multi-threaded applications</title>

<para>
If an already existing package is planned to be used in a
multi-threaded environment, some language constructs must be replaced
by different ones. For example, global variables must be protected by
locks (mutexes). Because of
this it is common practice to provide two versions of such packages,
one for single-, one for multi-threaded applications (or, another
technique, there is a special add-on module that initializes a 
library for multi-threaded usage).
</para>

<para>
The predicate "mt" should be used to recognize multi-threaded
applications. For example, a package could consist of two archives,
p.cma, and p_mt.cma, where the latter archive is designed for
multi-threaded execution. The META file would contain the following
lines causing that always the appropriate archive is linked:
</para>

<programlisting>
archive(byte) = "p.cma"
archive(byte,mt) = "p_mt.cma"
</programlisting>

<para>
When querying the package database the option "-predicates mt" must be
included in the commands in order to select the appropriate entries.
</para>

<para>
When compiling or linking it is necessary to specify either the
"-thread" or the "-vmthread" option anyway. The compiler frontends
detects these options, and automatically set the "mt"
predicate. The following command is an example for this; note that the
"threads" package means the standard library of Ocaml providing thread
support:
</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -thread -package threads,p,q -c x.ml
</programlisting>

<para>
For some operating systems, Ocaml supports the native multithreading
libraries conforming to the POSIX interface. As the linker options are
generally different, another predicate must be set to get these
libraries linked in. The predicate "mt_posix" indicates POSIX
threads while "mt_vm" indicates bytecode (virtual machine) threads.
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1>
<title>Support for gprof-enabled modules</title>

<para>
When a program is compiled and linked with ocamlopt, gprof-style
profiling can be enabled by selecting the -p option. This means that
the resulting archives are different, and that it would be useful if
there were another predicate in order to select such archives.
</para>

<para>
The predicate "gprof" can be used for this. It is automatically set if
the -p option turns on the gprof-mode in an ocamlopt invocation.
</para>

<title>The standard predicates</title>

<para>
Settings in the META file have usually the form:
</para>

<programlisting>
varname ( predname1, predname2, ... ) = "value"
</programlisting>

<para>
The names in the parantheses are called <emphasis>formal
predicates</emphasis> and express a condition which must hold such
that the value on the right side is selected. When querying
information you can specify a set of <emphasis> actual
predicates</emphasis> that are assumed to be true. There are the
following standard predicates:
</para>

<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
<listitem>
<para>
The "byte" predicate means that the bytecode compiler is used.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The "native" predicate means that the native compiler is used.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The "toploop" predicate means that the toploop is available in the
linked program.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>

</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The "mt_posix" predicate means that in the case "mt" is set, too, the
POSIX libraries are used to implement threads.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The "mt_vm" predicate means that in the case "mt" is set, too, the
VM-based libraries are used to implement threads.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The "gprof" predicate means that in the case "native" is set, too, the
program is compiled for profiling
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The "autolink" predicate indicates that ocamlc is able to perform
automatic linking.
</para>
</listitem>


</itemizedlist>

<para>
It is possible to have more predicates indicating different
environments; just use them, it is not necessary to declare them
anywhere.
</para>

<para>
The value which is selected for a variable depends on the set of
assumed predicates. In order to get selected, all formal predicates
must be included in the set of actual predicates; if still
multiple values fulfill this condition, the value with the maximum
number of formal predicates is used; and if still in doubt, the first
of these in the META file is taken.
</para>

<para>
It is possible to negate a formal predicate: Just prepend a minus
sign to it, e.g. var(p,-q). In this case, it is required that the
negated predicates are false (not contained in the set of actual predicates).
</para>

<para>
For all variables that are evaluated after the dependency analysis,
findlib adds the so-called package predicates to the set of actual
predicates. For every selected package p the predicate pkg_p 
(with the fixed prefix "pkg_") is added. One application of this
are compatibility checks: The special <literal>error</literal> variable
is evaluated after dependency analysis, but before anything else
is done. For example, to state that package p is incompatible with
package q one can add to the META file of p:

<programlisting>
error(pkg_q) = "Package p is incompatible with q"
</programlisting>

The value of <literal>error</literal> is printed as message in the
case the condition is true.</para>

</sect1>


<sect1>
<title>Defining additional predicates</title>

<para>
Additional predicates can be simply used without any declaration,
i.e. you can freely invent new predicates. One application of them
is to express conditional linkage. For example, one may provide archives
for various conditions, such as a production archive, and a
development archive. A single new predicate, "development", would be
sufficient to express this:
</para>

<programlisting>
archive(byte) = "p_production.cma"
archive(byte,development) = "p_development.cma"
</programlisting>

<para>
When linking, include a "-predicates development" argument in the
compiler command to select the development archive, otherwise the
production archive is taken.
</para>

<para>
Predicates could also be used to select among several implementations
of the same module. Define simply one predicate per implementation,
e.g. "p_impl1", "p_impl2", and "p_impl3", and specify the archives for
every implementation separately:
</para>

<programlisting>
archive(byte,p_impl1) = "p_impl1.cma"
archive(byte,p_impl2) = "p_impl2.cma"
archive(byte,p_impl3) = "p_impl3.cma"
</programlisting>

<para>
In the case that the implementations have different dependencies,
simply provide multiple "requires" variables:
</para>

<programlisting>
requires(p_impl1) = "q"
requires(p_impl2) = "q,r"
requires(p_impl3) = "r,s"
</programlisting>

<para>
Sometimes, the implementations require different linker options. In
this case, define several versions of the "linkopts" variable just
like in the "requires" example.
</para>

<para>
Note that predicates are global identifiers that can be potentially
applied to every selected package. In the case that a predicate is
only meaningful for a single package, it is common practice to 
choose the package name as prefix of the predicate name (e.g.
"netstring_minimum" is a predicate usually only applied to the "netstring"
package).
<para>

<para>
Predicates could be used to select which features of a library are
linked. For example,

<programlisting>
archive(byte) = "p_basic.cma"
archive(byte,p_extension) = "p_basic.cma p_ext.cma"
</programlisting>

would add the p_ext.cma archive only if the p_extension predicate
were set. <emphasis>It is considered as bad practice to select
extensions of libraries by predicates. Findlib provides the construct
of subpackages for this purpose.</emphasis>
</para>
</sect1>


<sect1>
	<title>Appending to variables</title>

<para>The syntax

<programlisting>
varname ( predname1, predname2, ... ) += "value"
</programlisting>

(note the "+=" operator) can be used to append values to variables
depending on whether predicates are true. The "+=" lines in the META
file are evaluated one after the other, and <emphasis>every</emphasis>
line is selected for which the formal predicates are satisfied, 
and these lines are added to the current value of the variable. This is
different from the "=" operator where only the most specific
assignment is taken.
</para>

<para>The values are considered as space-separated words when they
are appended, i.e. the new words are added to the list of current
words.</para>

<para>For example, in the hypothetic META file

<programlisting>
var(p) += "a"
var(p,q) += "b"
</programlisting>

the value of var is "a b" if both p and q are true, and the value is
only "a" is only p is true (and the value is empty otherwise). If
the operator "=" had been used, the value would have been only "b"
when both p and q are true.</para>

<para>In the case that there both "=" and "+=" settings for
the same variable, a special algorithm is used: First the most specific
"=" setting is determined, and second all matching "+=" settings are
appended in the order they appear in the file.</para>

<para>Finally, here is a real-world example. Imagine you have an
archive p.cma and a special extension for the toploop, p_top.cma.
Furthermore, there is a special debugging version p_dev.cma that
replaces p.cma during development. You can now simply write

<programlisting>
archive(byte) = "p.cma"
archive(byte,development) = "p_dev.cma"
archive(byte,toploop) += "p_top.cma"
</programlisting>

to select <emphasis>either</emphasis> p.cma or p_dev.cma, and append
p_top.cma for toploops to whatever was selected in the first step.</para>
</sect1>



<sect1>
	<title>Subpackages</title>

<para>
Sometimes a package consists of several archive files that are closely
related. It is now possible to express dependencies between these
archives by splitting the package into several parts called subpackages.
For example, package p consists of a base archive p_base.cma, and two
extensions p_ext1.cma and p_ext2.cma that both require the base archive
but are independent of each other. This META file expresses this
dependency directly:

<programlisting>
# META file of package p:
requires = "p.base"

package "base" (
  archive(byte) = "p_base.cma"
)

package "ext1" (
  requires = "p.base"
  archive(byte) = "p_ext1.cma"
)

package "ext2" (
  requires = "p.base"
  archive(byte) = "p_ext2.cma"
)
</programlisting>

If installed as package "p", this definition actually defines four
logical packages: "p" (the main package), "p.base", "p.ext1", and
"p.ext2" (the subpackages). These four entities only share the META
file in which they are declared, and the directory where the archive
files are stored, but all other properties can be individually set
for each package. This also means that all package dependencies
must explicitly added by "requires" variables, as there are no
implied dependencies. In this example, the main package and "p.ext1"
and "p.ext2" are all dependent on "p.base".
</para>

<para>
The users of this installation can refer to all four packages. This
means that

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -package p -linkpkg ...
</programlisting>

links only p_base.cma into the final program, while

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -package p.ext1 -linkpkg ...
</programlisting>

selects both p_base.cma and p_ext1.cma.
</sect1>



<sect1>
	<title>Glue code</title>

<para>Imagine we have two packages p and q that are normally
independent, i.e. one can link p without q, and q without p. However,
when both p and q are used in the same program, it is expected that
they cooperate with each other. Of course, this situation can be
modeled with the help of subpackages (a real-world example of this are
p=lablgtk and q=lablgl).</para>

<para>The idea is as follows: p has a subpackage p.for_q that contains
code with special features for q, and q has a subpackage q.use_p that
depends on p, p.for_q, and q, and that contains the code using the 
special features of p. Expressed in META files, p would define

<programlisting>
# META file for p:
requires = "..."
archive = "..."

package "for_q" (
  requires = "p"
  archive = "..."
)
</programlisting>

and q would define

<programlisting>
# META file for q:
requires = "..."
archive = "..."

package "use_p" (
  requires = "q,p.for_q"
  archive = "..."
)
</programlisting>

Of couse, the program using both libraries must explicitly enable
the subpackages by mentioning "q.use_p" on the ocamlfind command line,
otherwise the glue code would be omitted.
</para>

<para>
Unfortunately, it is not possible to use the package predicates
pkg_p and pkg_q to add archives depending on whether the other
package is also selected. The problem is that the order cannot
be specified, i.e. whether p must be linked first or q.
</para>
</sect1>



<sect1>
<title>Plugins</title>

<para><emphasis>(Since findlib-1.6.)</emphasis></para>

<para>
Plugins are packages that can be loaded at runtime. Plugins are
intended as a mechanism for loading add-on code into
executables. Technically, there is some overlap with the concept of a
"shared library". Note, however, that there is no universal support
for plugins, as it is unimplemented on some platforms, and only
poorly on some others (including x86 in the 32 bit case). Also, there
must always be an explicit "load" statement in the loading executable.
You cannot link an executable directly against plugins.
</para>

<sect2><title>Preparing a plugin</title>
<para>
For bytecode there is no problem to load cma files at runtime.
For native-code, though, you need to convert cmxa files into cmxs
files first:</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlopt -shared -linkall -o m.cmxs m.cmxa
</programlisting>

<para>As mentioned, be prepared that this command fails on platforms where
plugins are unavailable.</para>

<para>The cmxs files can then be referenced from META. We don't use
the "archive" variable in this case but "plugin":</para>

<programlisting>
plugin(byte) = "m.cma"
plugin(native) = "m.cmxs"
</programlisting>

<para>Before findlib-1.6, there was some half-official convention using the
"plugin" predicate. This is still supported, but deprecated:</para>

<programlisting>
archive(byte) = "m.cma"
archive(native,plugin) = "m.cmxs"
</programlisting>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Load-time dependencies</title>
<para>Plugins can be, of course, be dependent on other
plugins. You run into a problem, though, when you make a plugin dependent
on a package that doesn't qualify as plugin (i.e. lacks the "plugin"
definition). In this case, the loader simply skips the dependency,
and you cannot load the plugin.</para>

<para>Because of this dependency issue, it is recommended to add the
"plugin" variable to all packages that are installed on a system,
because this does not only allow it to load all packages at runtime, but
also to use these packages as dependency of the actual plugin code.</para>

<para>That said, you just need to add a "requires" directive, e.g.

<programlisting>
requires = "pkg1"
plugin(byte) = "m.cma"
plugin(native) = "m.cmxs"
</programlisting>
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>How to load a plugin</title>
<para>Linking an executable that can load a plugin: An executable
must link the package "findlib.dynload". This does not only add
the loader, but also special initialization code to the executable:</para>

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlopt -o program -package findlib.dynload -linkpkg ...
</programlisting>

<para>In particular, this records the packages that are already included
into the executable (in-core packages). If a plugin is now dependent
on such a package, this is recognized, and the package is not loaded
(which would not work anyway).</para>

<para>Now, you can load a plugin "foo" with:</para>

<programlisting>
Fl_dynload.load_packages ["foo"]
</programlisting>

<para>This loads the cma or cmxs files, and runs the initialization code
of all top-level definitions of the included modules.</para>

<para>Of course, you can also call <literal>load_packages</literal> from
a library if "findlib.dynload" is a required package of the library
package.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Fat plugins</title>
<para>Sometimes it is handy to create plugins that already include all
the required packages. The plugin acts more like a dynamically loadable
executable that already includes whatever it needs. You can create such
a "fat" plugin with:

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlopt -shared -linkpkg -linkall -o m.cmxs -package p1,p2,p3 m.cmxa
</programlisting>

In this case, the "requires" line in the META file should remain empty.
</para>

<para>
Note, however, that you cannot handle packages this way that are already
linked into the main program, because it is invalid to load a module that
is already part of the main executable. Let's assume that the executable
links in q1, q2, and q3. Then, you need to exclude these packages from the
plugin. The -dont-link option comes handy in this case:

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlopt -shared -linkpkg -linkall -o m.cmxs -package p1,p2,p3 -dont-link q1,q2,q3 m.cmxa
</programlisting>

This excludes q1,q2,q3 even if these packages occur as dependencies of
p1,p2,p3. In this case, though, you need to put q1,q2,q3 into the "requires"
field of META.

<para>
As it has become more and more complicated to write correct META files
there is now some support for recognizing typical problems. Just use

<programlisting>
ocamlfind lint META
</programlisting>

to check the file META in the current directory. The tool reports problematic
lines in META, e.g.

<programlisting>
archive(byte,plugin) = "oUnit.cma"
This specification of dynamic loading is deprecated, you should add a "plugin(...)" variable.

archive(native,plugin) = "oUnit.cmxs"
This specification of dynamic loading is deprecated, you should add a "plugin(...)" variable.

<title>How to create your own packages</title>

<title>Installing and removing packages</title>

<para>
The ocamlfind command can install and remove packages. For example,
to install a package p containing the files META, m1.cmi, m2.cmi, p.cma,
run

<programlisting>
ocamlfind install p META m1.cmi m2.cmi p.cma
</programlisting>

This installs the files into the default location for new packages
(set in ocamlfind.conf). If you have files that are not always built,
add these after the -optional switch:

<programlisting>
ocamlfind install p META m1.cmi m2.cmi p.cma -optional p.cmxa p.cmxs
</programlisting>

To remove the package, run

<programlisting>
ocamlfind remove p
</programlisting>

Note that every package must have a META file, it is not possible to
omit it.
</para>

<sect1>
<title>Change your Makefile</title>

<para>
Here is a commented version of a Makefile that may be used to compile
and link a package. It describes the frequent case that the package
simply consists of a bundle of modules that are dependent on other
packages.
</para>

<para>
First, some general definitions. NAME is the name of the package.  The
OBJECTS variable enumerates the bytecode objects, whereas XOBJECTS
names the native objects. The same naming convention is used for
ARCHIVE and XARCHIVE, specifying the resulting bytecode, resp. native
archive file. The REQUIRES variable lists the names of the packages
that are needed for this package.  If you need additional predicates,
put them into the PREDICATES variable.
</para>

<programlisting>
NAME     = p

OCAMLC   = ocamlfind ocamlc
OCAMLOPT = ocamlfind ocamlopt
OCAMLDEP = ocamldep

OBJECTS  = p1.cmo p2.cmo
XOBJECTS = p1.cmx p2.cmx

ARCHIVE  = $(NAME).cma
XARCHIVE = $(NAME).cmxa
SARCHIVE = $(NAME).cmxs

REQUIRES = unix str q r s
PREDICATES =
</programlisting>

<para>
The default goal is "all", causing the bytecode archive to be
created. In order to get a native archive, choose "opt" as second goal.
(The ".PHONY" line is a declaration meaningful for GNU-make; "all" and
"opt" are only virtual goals as there no files "all", or "opt" which
is indicated by making them dependents of ".PHONY".)
</para>

<programlisting>
.PHONY: all opt
all: $(ARCHIVE)
opt: $(XARCHIVE) $(SARCHIVE)
</programlisting>

<para>
The following two rules create the bytecode resp. native archive from
the objects.
</para>

<programlisting>
$(ARCHIVE): $(OBJECTS)
        $(OCAMLC) -a -o $(ARCHIVE) -package "$(REQUIRES)" -linkpkg \
	          -predicates "$(PREDICATES)" $(OBJECTS)
$(XARCHIVE): $(XOBJECTS)
        $(OCAMLOPT) -a -o $(XARCHIVE) -package "$(REQUIRES)" -linkpkg \
	          -predicates "$(PREDICATES)" $(XOBJECTS)

$(SARCHIVE): $(XARCHIVE)
        $(OCAMLOPT) -shared -o $(SARCHIVE) $(XARCHIVE) || true
</programlisting>

<para>
Note that the cmxs archive is optional: we just ignore the error
when it cannot be built.
</para>

<para>
These rules compile the modules independently. The lines similar to
".ml.cmo" must be read: "How to transform files with suffix .ml into
files with suffix .cmo". The corresponding command can refer to the
input file as "$&lt;" and to the output file(s) as "$@".
</para>

<programlisting>
.SUFFIXES: .cmo .cmi .cmx .ml .mli

.ml.cmo:
        $(OCAMLC) -package "$(REQUIRES)" -predicates "$(PREDICATES)" \
                  -c $&lt;
.mli.cmi:
        $(OCAMLC) -package "$(REQUIRES)" -predicates "$(PREDICATES)" \
                  -c $&lt;
.ml.cmx:
        $(OCAMLOPT) -package "$(REQUIRES)" -predicates "$(PREDICATES)" \
                  -c $&lt;
</programlisting>

<para>
The "depend" goal is the file describing the dependencies within the
package; it is created by ocamldep.
</para>

<programlisting>
depend: *.ml *.mli
         $(OCAMLDEP) *.ml *.mli &gt;depend
include depend
</programlisting>

<para>
The "install" rule is a bit tricky. First it is tested if there is a
native archive to install, and if so, the variable "extra" contains
the corresponding files. The "ocamlfind install" command creates a new
package directory and puts the given files into it.
</para>

<programlisting>
.PHONY: install uninstall
install: all
	 ocamlfind install $(NAME) *.mli *.cmi $(ARCHIVE) META \
             -optional $(XARCHIVE) $(SARCHIVE)

uninstall:
         ocamlfind remove $(NAME)
</programlisting>

<para>
Last but not least a cleanup rule:
</para>

<programlisting>
.PHONY: clean
         rm -f *.cmi *.cmo *.cmx *.cma *.cmxa *.a
</programlisting>
</sect1>


<sect1>
<title>Using the Makefile wizard</title>

<para>
Especially for beginners, the findlib distribution includes a GUI to
create Makefiles.  As this is an optional feature, it must have been
selected when findlib was built (option -with-toolbox). To invoke the
GUI, run the command

<programlisting>
$ ocamlfind findlib/make_wizard
</programlisting>

(Btw, this is the general syntax to run executables installed in
package directories.) The wizard starts, and allows you to describe
your project. When you save the result, not only a "Makefile" is
created, but also the file ".make-wizard" containing the state.
If you later start the wizard again, this file will be automatically
loaded, and you can modify your definition.</para>

<para>The wizard consists of seven (hopefully self-explanatory) pages
you can fill out. The basic idea is that the .ml, .mli, .mly, and .mll
files in the current directory are compiled to a .cma or .cmxa
archive, and that optionally executables are created from this archive
and from additional modules (main programs). This scheme can be both
used for libraries and application programs.</para>

<para>You can choose packages you want to use in your library or
program by clicking at them in a selection box.  The camlp4 syntax
parsers can be optionally enabled. The modules to be compiled can 
be picked from the current directory, they must be selected in the
right order, however.</para>

<para>The generated "Makefile" defines a number of logical targets
(like "all", "opt", etc) that are explained at the beginning of the
file. The file is fully commented, and not very difficult to understand.
Only traditional Makefile syntax is used, so it is expected that it
works for every version of the "make" utility.
</para>

<para>When you build the project, the META file is created
dynamically.  If you do not like this, set the variable MAKE_META to
the empty string.  (It is a good idea to put such setting into a
second file, and enter the name of this file into the box "Local
extensions in" of the wizard, so you can generate the "Makefile" again
without overwriting your own modifications.  This second file can
override the setting in the generated "Makefile".)

<chapter>
<title>FAQs</title>

<sect1>
<title>Does findlib support the autolink feature of O'Caml 3?</title>

<para>
<emphasis>Short answer:</emphasis> Findlib is compatible with autolink
</para>

<para>
The new archive format introduced with O'Caml 3 can store the linker options
that are necessary to link an archive. For example:

<programlisting>
ocamlc -a -o myarchive.cma mymodule.cmo -cclib -lmylibrary
</programlisting>

This command does not only create the new archive
<literal>myarchive.cma</literal>, but it also writes into a special section of
that file that the linker option <literal>-cclib -lmylibrary</literal> is
necessary to link this archive.
</para>

<para>
This means for findlib that most of the "linkopts" attributes in META files
have become superflous: The compiler itself already knows the linker options,
we do not need to tell the compiler the options. We could simply leave all
"linkopts" attributes out.
</para>

<para>
Of course, the "linkopts" feature of findlib still works. This is necessary
because findlib should keep the compatibility with older software, and because
"linkopts" is more powerful (you can have conditional linker options).
</para>

<para>
If you have software that must run in both O'Caml 2 and O'Caml 3 environments,
you can make your "linkopts" attribute dependent on the "autolink"
predicate. For example:

<programlisting>
linkopts = "-cclib -lmylibrary"
linkopts(autolink) = ""
</programlisting>

The findlib installation for O'Caml 3 will take the second line which is
reasonable because ocamlc already knows how to link; the installation for
O'Caml 2 never sets the "autolink" predicate and therefore uses the first line.
</para>
      </sect1>



      <sect1>
	<title>Why does findlib not automatically include the -custom option if
linked with C code?</title>

	<para><emphasis>Short answer:</emphasis>
Because there are several ways of linking, and findlib is not the
right instance to find out the right way</para>

	<para>Recent versions of OCaml support DLLs, at least for some
platforms. Here, the option -custom is not necessary at all, because the
C libraries can be looked up and loaded at runtime. The option -custom
would have the effect of forcing static linking.</para>

	<para>But even for platforms without DLL support, there are two
alternatives. One possibility is to use -custom, and the other is to
create runtime systems with -make-runtime, and reference them with
-use-runtime. Fortunately, recent versions of OCaml select now themselves
-custom automatically if -make-runtime is omitted, so findlib needs not to
bother with it.
</para>
      </sect1>



      <sect1>
	<title>Does findlib support linking of applications as well as
packages?</title>

	<para>
<emphasis>Short answer:</emphasis> Yes, but it is not very obvious</para>

	<para>
Applications also depend on other components, they have predicates, sometimes
they need linker options; there seems to be only little difference between
applications (stand-alone programs) and packages. If you want to use the
findlib mechanisms for applications, too, the following trick helps.
</para>

	<para>
The environment variable <literal>OCAMLPATH</literal> may contain a
colon-separated path of possible sitelib locations. It is allowed to include
"." into the path (Shell commands follow):

<programlisting>
OCAMLPATH=.
export OCAMLPATH
</programlisting>

This makes ".", i.e.  your current directory, another sitelib location. You may
now put the components of your applications into subdirectories together with
META files; the hierarchy might look as follows:

<programlisting>
./Makefile                          global Makefile
./localpkg1/META                    first local package directory: Contains META
./localpkg1/...                     ... and more
./localpkg2/META                    second local package dir: Contains META
./localpkg2/...                     ... and more
...
</programlisting>

From findlib's point of view, these directories are now package directories,
and you can refer to them on the command line:

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -o ... -linkpkg -package localpkg1,localpkg2,...
</programlisting>

If you do not want subdirectories, you can also refer to the META file in the
same directory by the name ".", e.g.:

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -o ... -linkpkg -package .
</programlisting>

In this case, the linking information will be taken from
<literal>./META</literal>.
</para>

      <sect1>
        <title>
	  Does Findlib support camlp4?
        </title>

	<para>
	<emphasis>Short answer:</emphasis> Yes, but there is only little
	documentation.</para>

	<para>
	Since Findlib-0.4, there is some experimental camlp4 support. For
example, the following compiler invocation chooses the revised syntax:

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -syntax camlp4r -package camlp4 -c file.ml
</programlisting>

        As you can see, camlp4 must be included as package, and the
-syntax option must specify which syntax is selected (either
<literal>camlp4o</literal> or <literal>camlp4r</literal>).</para>

        <para>
	If you want to pass additional options to the preprocessor,
you can use the <literal>-ppopt</literal> option:

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -syntax camlp4r -package camlp4 -ppopt pa_ifdef.cmo -c file.ml
</programlisting>
        </para>

	<para>
From the toploop, the following commands work:

<programlisting>
$ ocaml
        Objective Caml version 3.07+2
 
# #use "./topfind";;
- : unit = ()
Findlib has been successfully loaded. Additional directives:
  #require "package";;      to load a package
  #list;;                   to list the available packages
  #camlp4o;;                to load camlp4 (standard syntax)
  #camlp4r;;                to load camlp4 (revised syntax)
  #predicates "p,q,...";;   to set these predicates
  Topfind.reset();;         to force that packages will be reloaded
  #thread;;                 to enable threads
 
- : unit = ()
# #camlp4o;;            (* or camlp4r *)

# _
</programlisting>

<sect2>
<title>The concept</title>
<para>
If you have a <literal>-syntax</literal> option on the command line,
ocamlfind will generate a <literal>-pp</literal> parameter and pass it to the
invoked compiler. This is performed as follows: The specified packages are
inspected under a certain set of predicates, the <emphasis>syntax
predicates</emphasis>. The syntax predicates are <literal>syntax</literal>,
<literal>preprocessor</literal>, and the predicates following
<literal>-syntax</literal>. The predicate <literal>syntax</literal> simply
means that the <literal>-syntax</literal> option has been specified.
The predicate <literal>preprocessor</literal> means that the preprocessor
command is being constructed. The predicates added by
<literal>-syntax</literal> may be used to distinguish between syntax variants
(currently <literal>camlp4o</literal> and <literal>camlp4r</literal>).
</para>

<para>The packages are searched for a variable <literal>preprocessor</literal>;
normally the <literal>camlp4</literal> package defines it as (see its META
file):

<programlisting>
preprocessor = "camlp4 -nolib"
</programlisting>

Now that the name of the preprocessor command is known, the arguments of the
command are looked up. The META files are evaluated under the syntax
predicates, and all <literal>archive</literal> variables are collected and
passed as arguments to the preprocessor. For example, the camlp4 package
defines:

<programlisting>
archive(syntax,preprocessor,camlp4o) = "pa_o.cmo pa_op.cmo pr_dump.cmo"
archive(syntax,preprocessor,camlp4r) = "pa_r.cmo pa_rp.cmo pr_dump.cmo"
</programlisting>

Note that the predicate <literal>preprocessor</literal> prevents ocamlfind from
including these archives into the regular list of archives to link.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>How to write a META file for your own syntax extension</title>
<para>
Suppose you have two archives: <literal>pa_myext.cma</literal> contains the
extension code of camlp4, and <literal>run_myext.cma</literal> contains runtime
material that must be present in programs compiled with your extensions. Your
META file should look as follows:

<programlisting>
requires = "camlp4"
archive(syntax,toploop) = "pa_myext.cma run_myext.cma"
archive(syntax,preprocessor) = "pa_myext.cma"
archive(syntax,byte)    = "run_myext.cma"
archive(syntax,native)  = "run_myext.cmxa"
</programlisting>

You may add dependencies on <literal>camlp4o</literal> or
<literal>camlp4r</literal> if you have archives only working for one of the two
syntax variants.
</para>

<para>To compile a program using your syntax extension package, one should use:

<programlisting>
ocamlfind ocamlc -package yourname -syntax variant ...
</programlisting>
</para>
</sect2>

	<sect2>
	  <title>Example</title>

<para>The package <literal>xstrp4</literal> defines a syntax extension allowing
$-substitutions in O'Caml strings. Version 1.0 of this package takes advantage
from the new camlp4 support of findlib; you may have a look at it for an
example.</para>

      <sect1>
        <title>
	  Does Findlib support ppx-style preprocessors?
        </title>

	<para>
	<emphasis>Short answer:</emphasis> Yes, but there is only little
	documentation.</para>

        <para>Since findlib-1.5, ppx-style preprocessors are supported
to some extent. A package can now define a "ppx" property which is simply
a command to run as preprocessor (the command gets the marshalled AST
as input, and must generate the transformed AST in its output; see the
-ppx option of ocamlc/ocamlopt). A META file can simply look like:

<programlisting>
ppx = "./command"
</programlisting>

when "command" is installed in the package directory (but you can also
omit "./" to search it, and you can prefix it with "@name/" if the command
is taken from another package "name").
</para>

	<para>For more complex scenarios, additional options or
arguments for the ppx preprocessor can be specified in descendant
packages with the "ppxopt" property. Package "A" might provide a
generic ppx preprocessor with a META file containing

<programlisting>
ppx = "./generic_ppx"
</programlisting>

Package B might instantiate that preprocessor with

<programlisting>
requires = "A"
ppxopt = "A,ppx_b.cmo"
</programlisting>

In this case "ocamlfind ocamlc -package B" would
add <literal>-ppx "path_to_A/genric_ppx ppx_b.cmo"</literal> to
the ocamlc invocation. The format of the "ppxopt" property is
specified in the findlib reference manual.
</para>


        <para>This feature is still a bit experimental.</para>

      </sect1>


      <sect1>
	<title>Why do some people install the .cmx files?</title>

	<para>In principle, it is not necessary to install the .cmx
files created by the ocamlopt compiler, as the .a and .cmxa files
already contain the assembly code and all needed auxiliary information.
However, it may be sensible to install the .cmx files, too. They
contain the intermediate code of small functions that are candidates
for inlining, and installing them allows the compiler to do inlining
even across library boundaries. Note that only very small functions
can be inlined at all, and that there are language elements that
prevent inlining (e.g. raising an exception with an argument), so
it makes only sense when the library actually has such functions
and really profits from inlining.</para>

	<para>Inlining has also disadvantages: The library can no 
longer be replaced by a different version even if the interface
remains exactly the same, because code using the library may have
inlined code of the old version.</para>
      </sect1>


      <sect1>
	<title>How do I express conflicts?</title>

	<para>A conflict means that a certain combination of packages
and package features will not work. A number of conflict conditions
can be expressed:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>To state that a package will not work if a certain
predicate is set, use the <literal>error</literal> variable. For example,
when package p does not work for multi-threaded programs:

<programlisting>
error(mt) = "Package p is incompatible with multi-threaded programs"
</programlisting>

This works for other standard predicates, too.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>To state that a package will not work together with
another package, it is possible to make <literal>error</literal> dependent
on package predicates. For example, when package p does not work
together with q:

<programlisting>
error(pkg_q) = "Package p is incompatible with package q"
</programlisting>

This also works with subpackages (e.g. <literal>pkg_q.q_sub</literal>).
	    </para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>If an error is too much, it might be a good idea to
              just inform the user about possible problems. In this case
              you can emit a warning instead:
            </para>

<programlisting>
warning(pkg_q) = "Using package p and q together is a really bad idea"
</programlisting>

	</itemizedlist>

<para>Note that such error conditions should only be added if there is
absolutely no chance to get the combination of packages and features running.
For example, in the case of multi-threaded programs it is often possible
to add wrappers around unsafe libraries to fix the incompatibility.
	</para>

<para>It is not possible to express incompatibilities between package
versions. Such incompatibilities should be detected when software is
installed, not when it is used.</para>
