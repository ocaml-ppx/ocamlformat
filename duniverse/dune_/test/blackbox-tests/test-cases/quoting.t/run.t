This behavior is surprising, we should get an error about the fact
that ${@} is not quoted and doesn't contain exactly 1 element

  $ dune build --root bad x
  Entering directory 'bad'
  File "dune", line 3, characters 27-35:
  3 |  (action (with-stdout-to %{targets} (echo foo))))
                                 ^^^^^^^^
  Error: Variable %{targets} expands to 2 values, however a single value is
  expected here. Please quote this atom.
  [1]

The targets should only be interpreted as a single path when quoted

  $ dune build --root good s
  Entering directory 'good'
  File "dune", line 1, characters 0-72:
  1 | (rule
  2 |  (targets s t)
  3 |  (action (with-stdout-to "%{targets}" (echo foo))))
  Error: Rule failed to generate the following targets:
  - s
  - t
