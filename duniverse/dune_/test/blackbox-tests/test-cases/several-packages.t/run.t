If two packages are available and no (package) is present, an error message is
displayed. This can happen for:

- (executable)

  $ dune build --root executable
  Entering directory 'executable'
  File "dune", line 1, characters 0-43:
  1 | (executable
  2 |   (public_name an_executable)
  3 | )
  Error: I can't determine automatically which package this stanza is for.
  I have the choice between these ones:
  - pkg1 (because of pkg1.opam)
  - pkg2 (because of pkg2.opam)
  You need to add a (package ...) field to this (executable) stanza.

  $ dune build --root documentation
  Entering directory 'documentation'
  File "dune", line 1, characters 0-15:
  1 | (documentation)
