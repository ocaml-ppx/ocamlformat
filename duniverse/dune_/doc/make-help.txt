Welcome to Dune!
================

For users
---------

To build dune in release mode, please run:

  $ make release

You can then install dune on your system by typing:

  $ make install

You can pass PREFIX=<dir> to "make install" in order to install Dune
in a specific directory.

Note that "make release" won't rebuild Dune if you modify it. Use
"make dev" if you want to modify it.

For developers
--------------

All the following commands build Dune in development mode, i.e. with
more warnings enabled. You should build Dune this way if you intend to
work on Dune.

Here are the following commands you can use:

- make dev       to build the dune binary
- make test      to build and run the testsuite
- make doc       to build the Dune manual (requires sphinx)
- make livedoc   to build the Dune manual and serve it

You can customize the default target by writing a Makefile.dev file.
