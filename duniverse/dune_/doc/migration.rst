Migration
*********

Dune was initially called Jbuilder. Up to mid-2018, the package was still called
`jbuilder` which only installed a `jbuilder` binary. This document explain how
the migration to Dune will happen.

Timeline
========

The general idea is that the migration is gradual and existing
Jbuilder projects don't need to be updated all at once. We encourage
users to switch their development repositories and continue their
usual release cycle. There is no need to re-release existing packages
just to switch to Dune immediately.

The plan is as follows:

July 2018: release of Dune 1.0.0
--------------------------------

First release of the opam package `dune`. The `jbuilder` package
becomes a transitional package that depends on `dune`.

The `dune` package installs two binaries: `dune` and `jbuilder`. These
two binaries are exactly the same and they work on both Jbuilder and
Dune projects. Additionally they recognize both Jbuilder and Dune
configuration files. The new Dune configuration files are described
later in this document.

January 2019: deprecation of Jbuilder
-------------------------------------

At this point, the `jbuilder` binary emits a warning on every startup
inviting users to switch to `dune`. When encountering `jbuild` or
other Jbuilder configuration files, both binaries emit a warning. The
rest is unchanged.

During this period, it makes sense for projects to do new releases
just to switch to Dune if none of their existing releases is using
Dune.

July 2019: support for Jbuilder is dropped
------------------------------------------

`jbuilder` is now a dummy executable that always exit with an error
message on startup. `dune` no longer reads `jbuild` or other Jbuidler
configuration files but still prints a warning when encountering
them.

At this point, a conflict with newer versions of `dune` will be added
to all opam packages that rely on the `jbuilder` binary or Jbuilder
configuration files.

January 2020: the jbuilder binary goes away
-------------------------------------------

The `dune` package no longer installs a `jbuilder` binary. The rest is
unchanged.

Distant future
--------------

Once we are sure there are no more `jbuild` files out there, Dune will
completely ignore `jbuild` and other Jbuilder configuration files.

Check list
==========

This section is a concise list of migration tasks that will be required to
transition from jbuilder to dune.

New configuration files
-----------------------

Until July 2019, `dune` will still read `jbuild` and other Jbuilder
configuration files. There is no change in these files.

However, based on the experience acquired since the first release of
Jbuilder, we made a few changes in the configuration files read by
Dune. The most notable ones are the following:

- `jbuild` files are renamed simply `dune`
- projects now have a `dune-project` file at their root
- `jbuild-ignore` files are replaced by `ignored_subdirs` stanzas in
  `dune` files
- `jbuild-workspace` are replaced by `dune-workspace` files
- `jbuild-workspace<suffix>` files no longer mean anything

Following are detailed explanation of the differences between the
Jbuilder configuration files and the Dune ones.

dune-project files
------------------

These are a new kind of file. With Jbuilder, projects used to be
identified by the presence of at least one `<package>.opam` file in a
directory. This will still be supported until July 2019, however as
Jbuilder evolved it became clear that we needed project files, so Dune
introduces `dune-project` files to mark the root of projects.

Eventually, we are hoping that Dune will generate opam files. So users
will only have to write a `dune-project` file.

The purpose of this file is to:

- delimit projects in larger workspaces

- set a few project-wide parameters, such as the name, the version of the Dune
  language in use or specification of extra features (plugins) used in the
  project

Eventually, for users who wish to do so it should be possible to
centralize all the configuration of a project in this file.

dune files
----------

These are the same as `jbuild` files.

dune-workspace
--------------

These are the same as `jbuild-workspace` files.

When looking for the root of the workspace, Jbuilder also looks for
files whose name start with `jbuild-workspace`, such as
`jbuild-workspace.in`. This rule will be kept until July 2019, however
it is not preserved for `dune-workspace` files. I.e. a
`dune-workspace.in` file means nothing.

This rule was only useful when we didn't have project files.

Variable syntax
---------------

``${foo} and $(foo)`` are no longer valid variable syntax in dune files.
Variables are defined as ``%{foo}``. This change is done to simplify
interoperability with bash commands which also use the ``${foo}`` syntax.

``(files_recursively_in ..)`` is removed
----------------------------------------

The ``files_recursively_in`` dependency specification is invalid in dune files.
A :ref:`source_tree <source_tree>` stanza has been introduced to reflect the
actual function of this stanza.

Escape sequences
----------------

Invalid escape sequences of the form ``\x`` where ``x`` is a character other
than ``[0-9]``, ``x``, ``n``, ``r``, ``t``, ``b`` are not allowed in dune files.

Comments syntax
---------------

Block comments of the form ``#| ... |#`` and comments of the form ``#;`` are not
supported in dune files.

Renamed variables
-----------------

All existing variables have been lowercased for consistency. Other variables
have always been renamed. Refer to this table for details:

======================== ============
Jbuild                    Dune
======================== ============
``${@}``                  ``%{targets}``
``${^}``                  ``%{deps}``
``${path:file}``          ``%{dep:file}``
``${SCOPE_ROOT}``         ``%{project_root}``
``${ROOT}``               ``%{workspace_root}``
``${findlib:..}``         ``%{lib:..}``
``${CPP}``                ``%{cpp}``
``${CC}``                 ``%{cc}``
``${CXX}``                ``%{cxx}``
``${OCAML}``              ``%{ocaml}``
``${OCAMLC}``             ``%{ocamlc}``
``${OCAMLOPT}``           ``%{ocamlopt}``
``${ARCH_SIXTYFOUR}``     ``%{arch_sixtyfour}``
``${MAKE}``               ``%{make}``
======================== ============

Removed variables
-----------------

``${path-no-dep:file}`` and ``${<}`` have been removed.

A named dependency should be used instead of ``${<}``. For instance
the following jbuild file:

.. code:: lisp

          (alias
           ((name   runtest)
            (deps   (input))
            (action (run ./test.exe %{<}))))

should be rewritten to the following dune file:

.. code:: lisp

          (rule
           (alias  runtest)
           (deps   (:x input))
           (action (run ./test.exe %{x})))

``# JBUILDER_GEN`` renamed
--------------------------

``# DUNE_GEN`` should be used instead of ``# JBUILDER_GEN`` in META templates.


jbuild-ignore (deprecated)
--------------------------

``jbuild-ignore`` files are deprecated and replaced by
:ref:`dune-subdirs` stanzas in ``dune`` files.
