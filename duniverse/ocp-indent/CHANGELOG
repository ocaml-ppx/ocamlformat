## 1.4.0
* license change: lessening the GPL to make ocp-indent easier to use as a library
* removed indent by default after most common operators (when align_ops is set)
* removed extra-indent in some pattern-matching cases

* Still some bug fixes (comments at end, nested ocamldoc tags, etc.)
* Man-page fixes (thanks to Kaustuv Chaudhuri)
* Temporarily disabled the non-functional state-marshalling function

  anyways.

## 1.2.1
