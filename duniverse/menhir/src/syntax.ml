(* The type [partial_grammar] describes the abstract syntax that is produced
   by the parsers (yacc-parser and fancy-parser).

   The type [grammar] describes the abstract syntax that is obtained after one
   or more partial grammars are joined (see [PartialGrammar]). It differs in
   that declarations are organized in a more useful way and a number of
   well-formedness checks have been performed. *)

(* In a somewhat fragile convention, in a partial grammar, a reference to a
   terminal symbol either is a normal identifier [LID], in which case it is
   the name of the terminal symbol, or is a quoted identifier [QID], in which
   case it is a token alias.

   Token aliases are eliminated by replacing them with the corresponding
   terminal symbols very early on during the joining of the partial grammars;
   see the module [ExpandTokenAliases].

   In a complete grammar, there are no token aliases any longer. That is,
   we keep track of the aliases that have been declared (they can be found
   via the field [tk_alias]), but we never use them, since they have been
   eliminated up front. *)

(* Attributes allow the user to annotate the grammar with information that is
   ignored by Menhir, but can be exploited by other tools, via the SDK. *)

(* Attributes can be attached in the following places:

   - with the grammar:         %[@bar ...]
   - with a terminal symbol:   %token FOO [@bar ...]
   - with a rule:              foo(X) [@bar ...]: ...
   - with a producer:          e = foo(quux) [@bar ...]
   - with an arbitrary symbol: %attribute FOO foo(quux) [@bar ...]

   After expanding away parameterized nonterminal symbols, things become
   a bit simpler, as %attribute declarations are desugared away. *)
