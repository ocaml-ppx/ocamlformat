(* The LALR automaton has exactly the same states as the LR(0) automaton, up
   to lookahead information. Therefore, we can use the same state numbers.
   Thus, the states and the transitions of the LALR automaton are the same as
   those of the LR(0) automaton! *)

(* This means that we have almost nothing to do: in fact, the only thing that
   we have to do is compute a mapping of LR(0) nodes to LR(1) states. *)

(* This computation can be viewed as a fixed point computation. In fact, it is
   a special kind of fixed point computation: it can be viewed as a forward
   data flow analysis where the graph is the LR(0) automaton and a property is
   an LR(1) state. *)

   equal to [s] if [s'] is a subet of [s]. (Yes, we live on the edge.) *)
