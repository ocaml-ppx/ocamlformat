(* The main algorithm, [LRijkstra], accumulates facts. A fact is a triple of a

   Such a fact means that this [position] can be reached, from the source
   state [Trie.source position], by consuming [word], under the assumption
   that the next input symbol is [lookahead]. *)

   trie should fit in about 17 bits (2^17 = 131072). *)

(* On a 32-bit machine, we are a bit more cramped! In Menhir's own fancy-parser,
   the number of terminal symbols is 27, the number of unique words is 566, and
   the total star size is 546. We allocate 12 bits for [word] and 11 bits for
   [position]. This is better than refusing to work altogether, but still not
   great. A more satisfactory approach might be to revert to heap allocation of
   facts when in 32-bit mode, but that would make the code somewhat ugly. *)

      this cannot possibly lead to a successful reduction. In practice,
      this refinement allows reducing the number of facts that go through
      the queue by a factor of two.

   2. [lookahead] is [any] iff the [current] state is
      solid. This sounds rather reasonable (when a state is entered
      by shifting, it is entered regardless of which symbol follows)
      and simplifies the implementation of the sub-module [F].

   - its first symbol [a], given by [W.first (word fact) (lookahead fact)];
   - its lookahead assumption [z], given by [lookahead fact].

   For every triple of [position], [a], and [z], we store at most one fact,
   (whose word has minimal length). Indeed, we are not interested in keeping
   track of several words that produce the same effect. Only the shortest such
   word is of interest.

   Thus, the total number of facts accumulated by the algorithm is at most
   [T.n^2], where [T] is the total size of the tries that we have constructed,
   and [n] is the number of terminal symbols. (This number can be quite large.
   [T] can be in the tens of thousands, and [n] can be over one hundred. These
   figures lead to a theoretical upper bound of 100M. In practice, for T=25K
   and n=108, we observe that the algorithm gathers about 7M facts.) *)

  (* We need to query the set of facts in two ways. In [register], we must test
     whether a proposed triple of [position], [a], [z] already appears in the
     set. In [query], we must find all facts that match a pair [current, z],
     where [current] is a state. (Note that [position] determines [current], but
     the converse is not true: a position contains more information besides the
     current state.)

     To address these needs, we use a two-level table. The first level is a
     matrix indexed by [current] and [z]. At the second level, we find sets of
     facts, where two facts are considered equal if they have the same triple of
     [position], [a], and [z]. In fact, we know at this level that all facts
     have the same [z] component, so only [position] and [a] are compared.

     Because our facts satisfy invariant 2, [z] is [any] if and only if the
     state [current] is solid. This means that we are wasting quite a

   consequences are of two kinds:

   - As in Dijkstra's algorithm, the new fact can be viewed as a newly
     discovered vertex. We study its (currently known) outgoing edges,
     and enqueue new facts in the priority queue.

   - Sometimes, a fact can also be viewed as a newly discovered edge. This is
     the case when the word that took us from [source] to [current]
     represents a production of the grammar and [current] is willing to
     reduce this production. We record the existence of this edge, and

     this outgoing edge. *)
