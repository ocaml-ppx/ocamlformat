(* This function determines whether two (core-equivalent) states are
   compatible, according to a criterion that is close to Pager's weak
   compatibility criterion.

   Pager's criterion guarantees that if a merged state has a potential
   conflict at [(i, j)] -- that is, some token [t] appears within the
   lookahead sets of both item [i] and item [j] -- then there exists a
   state in the canonical automaton that also has a potential conflict
   at [(i, j)] -- that is, some token [u] appears within the lookahead
   sets of both item [i] and item [j]. Note that [t] and [u] can be
   distinct.

   Pager has shown that his weak compatibility criterion is stable,
   that is, preserved by transitions and closure. This means that, if
   two states can be merged, then so can their successors. This is
   important, because merging two states means committing to merging
   their successors, even though we have not even built these
   successors yet.

   The criterion used here is a slightly more restrictive version of
   Pager's criterion, which guarantees equality of the tokens [t] and
   [u]. This is done essentially by applying Pager's original
   criterion on a token-wise basis. Pager's original criterion states
   that two states can be merged if the new state has no conflict or
   one of the original states has a conflict. Our more restrictive
   criterion states that two states can be merged if, for every token
   [t], the new state has no conflict at [t] or one of the original
   states has a conflict at [t].

   This modified criterion is also stable. My experiments show that it
   is almost as effective in practice: out of more than a hundred
   real-world sample grammars, only one automaton was affected, and
   only one extra state appeared as a result of using the modified
   criterion. Its advantage is to potentially make conflict
   explanations easier: if there appears to be a conflict at [t], then
   some conflict at [t] can be explained. This was not true when using
   Pager's original criterion. *)

(* A word of caution: reasoning about compatibility is tricky and often
   counter-intuitive. Here is a list of properties and non-properties:

   - Compatibility is reflexive and symmetric.

   - Compatibility is *not* transitive.

   - If two states A and B are in the subumption relation (i.e., one is a
     subset of the other), then A and B are compatible.

   - Compatibility is *not* monotonic. That is, it is *not* the case that if
     two states A and B are incompatible, then two larger states A' and B'
     must be incompatible as well. (The fact that the state A U B is
     compatible with itself shows that this is false.) In the contrapositive,
     it is *not* the case that if A and B are compatible, then two smaller
     states A' and B' must be compatible as well.

   - Compatibility is preserved by union of compatible states. That is, if
     A and B are compatible, then C is compatible with (A U B) if and only
     if C is compatible with both A and B. *)

(* This function determines whether two (core-equivalent) states can

   future.

   The rule is, if an item appears in one state with the singleton "#"
   as its lookahead set, then its lookahead set in the other state
   must contain "#".

   So, either the second lookahead set is also the singleton "#", and
   no end-of-stream conflict exists, or it is larger, and the second
   state already contains an end-of-stream conflict.

   Put another way, we do not want to merge two lookahead sets when one
   contains "#" alone and the other does not contain "#".

   I invented this rule to complement Pager's criterion. I believe,
   but I am not 100% sure, that it does indeed prevent end-of-stream
   conflicts and that it is stable.

   The rule is, we merge two states only if they agree on which
   reductions are permitted on the [error] token.

   Without this restriction, we might end up in a situation where we
   decide to introduce an [error] token into the input stream and
   perform a reduction, whereas a canonical LR(1) automaton,
   confronted with the same input string, would fail normally -- that
   is, it would introduce an [error] token into the input stream, but
   it would not be able to perform a reduction right away: the current
   state would be discarded.

   In the interest of more accurate (or sane, or predictable) error
   handling, I decided to introduce this restriction as of 20110124.
   This will cause an increase in the size of automata for grammars
   that use the [error] token. It might actually make the [error]
   token somewhat easier to use.

   Note that two sets can be in the subsumption relation and still
   be error-incompatible. Error-compatibility requires equality of
   the lookahead sets, restricted to [error].
