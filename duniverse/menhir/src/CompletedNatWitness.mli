(* This is the lattice of the natural numbers, completed with [Infinity], and
   ordered towards zero (i.e. [Infinity] is [bottom], [Finite 0] is [top]). *)

(* These numbers are further enriched with sequences of matching length. Thus,
   a lattice element is either [Finite (n, xs)], where [n] is a natural number
   and [xs] is a sequence of length [n]; or [Infinity]. The sequences [xs] are
   ignored by the ordering (e.g., [compare] ignores them) but are nevertheless
   constructed (e.g., [add] concatenates two sequences). They should be thought
   of as witnesses, or proofs, that explain why the number [n] was obtained. *)
