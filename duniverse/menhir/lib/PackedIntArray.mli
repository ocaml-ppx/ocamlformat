(* A packed integer array is represented as a pair of an integer [k] and
   a string [s]. The integer [k] is the number of bits per integer that we
   use. The string [s] is just an array of bits, which is read in 8-bit
   chunks. *)

(* The ocaml programming language treats string literals and array literals
   in slightly different ways: the former are statically allocated, while
   the latter are dynamically allocated. (This is rather arbitrary.) In the
   context of Menhir's table-based back-end, where compact, immutable
   integer arrays are needed, ocaml strings are preferable to ocaml arrays. *)

type t =
  int * string

(* [pack a] turns an array of integers into a packed integer array. *)

(* Because the sign bit is the most significant bit, the magnitude of
   any negative number is the word size. In other words, [pack] does
   not achieve any space savings as soon as [a] contains any negative
   numbers, even if they are ``small''. *)

val pack: int array -> t

(* [get t i] returns the integer stored in the packed array [t] at index [i]. *)

(* Together, [pack] and [get] satisfy the following property: if the index [i]
   is within bounds, then [get (pack a) i] equals [a.(i)]. *)

val get: t -> int -> int

(* [get1 t i] returns the integer stored in the packed array [t] at index [i].
   It assumes (and does not check) that the array's bit width is [1]. The
   parameter [t] is just a string. *)

val get1: string -> int -> int

(* [unflatten1 (n, data) i j] accesses the two-dimensional bitmap
   represented by [(n, data)] at indices [i] and [j]. The integer
   [n] is the width of the bitmap; the string [data] is the second
   component of the packed array obtained by encoding the table as
   a one-dimensional array. *)
