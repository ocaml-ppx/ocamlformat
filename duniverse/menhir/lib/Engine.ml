  (* The type [checkpoint] represents an intermediate or final result of the
     parser. See [EngineTypes]. *)

  (* The type [checkpoint] is presented to the user as a private type (see
     [IncrementalEngine]). This prevents the user from manufacturing
     checkpoints (i.e., continuations) that do not make sense. (Such
     continuations could potentially violate the LR invariant and lead to
     crashes.) *)

  (* 2017/03/29 Although [checkpoint] is a private type, we now expose a
     constructor function, [input_needed]. This function allows manufacturing
     a checkpoint out of an environment. For this reason, the type [env] must
     also be parameterized with ['a]. *)

    | Accepted of 'a
    | Rejected

  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* As of 2020/12/16, we introduce a choice between multiple error handling
     strategies. *)

  (* Regardless of the strategy, when a syntax error is encountered, the
     function [initiate] is called, a [HandlingError] checkpoint is produced,
     and (after resuming) the function [error] is called. This function checks
     whether the current state allows shifting, reducing, or neither, when the
     lookahead token is [error]. Its behavior, then, depends on the strategy,
     as follows. *)

  (* In the legacy strategy, which until now was the only strategy,

     - If shifting is possible, then a [Shifting] checkpoint is produced,
       whose field [please_discard] is [true], so (after resuming) an
       [InputNeeded] checkpoint is produced, and (after a new token
       has been provided) the parser leaves error-handling mode and
       returns to normal mode.

     - If reducing is possible, then one or more reductions are performed.
       Default reductions are announced via [AboutToReduce] checkpoints,
       whereas ordinary reductions are performed silently. (It is unclear
       why this is so.) The parser remains in error-handling mode, so
       another [HandlingError] checkpoint is produced, and the function
       [error] is called again.

     - If neither action is possible and if the stack is nonempty, then a
       cell is popped off the stack, then a [HandlingError] checkpoint is
       produced, and the function [error] is called again.

     - If neither action is possible and if the stack is empty, then the
       parse dies with a [Reject] checkpoint. *)

  (* The simplified strategy differs from the legacy strategy as follows:

     - When shifting, a [Shifting] checkpoint is produced, whose field
       [please_discard] is [false], so the parser does not request another
       token, and the parser remains in error-handling mode. (If the
       destination state of this shift transition has a default reduction,
       then the parser will perform this reduction as its next step.)

     - When reducing, all reductions are announced by [AboutToReduce]
       checkpoints.

     - If neither shifting [error] nor reducing on [error] is possible,
       then the parser dies with a [Reject] checkpoint. (The parser does
       not attempt to pop cells off the stack one by one.)

     This simplified strategy is appropriate when the grammar uses the [error]
     token in a limited way, where the [error] token always appears at the end
     of a production whose semantic action raises an exception (whose purpose
     is to signal a syntax error and perhaps produce a custom message). Then,
     the parser must not request one token past the syntax error. (In a REPL,
     that would be undesirable.) It must perform as many reductions on [error]
     as possible, then (if possible) shift the [error] token and move to a new
     state where a default reduction will be possible. (Because the [error]
     token always appears at the end of a production, no other action can
     exist in that state, so a default reduction must exist.) The semantic
     action raises an exception, and that is it. *)

  (* Let us note that it is also possible to perform no error handling at
     all, or to perform customized error handling, by stopping as soon as
     the first [ErrorHandling] checkpoint appears. *)

  type strategy =
    [ `Legacy | `Simplified ]

  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* In the code-based back-end, the [run] function is sometimes responsible
     for pushing a new cell on the stack. This is motivated by code sharing
     concerns. In this interpreter, there is no such concern; [run]'s caller
     is always responsible for updating the stack. *)

  (* In the code-based back-end, there is a [run] function for each state
     [s]. This function can behave in two slightly different ways, depending
     on when it is invoked, or (equivalently) depending on [s].

     If [run] is invoked after shifting a terminal symbol (or, equivalently,
     if [s] has a terminal incoming symbol), then [run] discards a token,
     unless [s] has a default reduction on [#]. (Indeed, in that case,
     requesting the next token might drive the lexer off the end of the input
     stream.)

     If, on the other hand, [run] is invoked after performing a goto
     transition, or invoked directly by an entry point, then there is nothing
     to discard.

     These two cases are reflected in [CodeBackend.gettoken].

     Here, the code is structured in a slightly different way. It is up to the
     caller of [run] to indicate whether to discard a token, via the parameter
     [please_discard]. This flag is set when [s] is being entered by shifting
     a terminal symbol and [s] does not have a default reduction on [#]. *)

  (* The following recursive group of functions are tail recursive, produce a
     checkpoint of type [semantic_value checkpoint], and cannot raise an
     exception. A semantic action can raise [Error], but this exception is
     immediately caught within [reduce]. *)

       will take us to [discard]. If [please_discard] is not set, we skip this
       step and jump directly to [check_for_default_reduction]. *)

     (and therefore, resume normal parsing), the lookahead symbol is clobbered
     anyway, since the only action that the user can take is to call [offer].
     So far, so good. One problem, though, is that this call to [offer] may
     well place the automaton in a configuration of a state [s] and a
     lookahead symbol [t] that is normally unreachable. Also, perhaps the
     state [s] is a state where an input symbol normally is never demanded, so
     this [InputNeeded] checkpoint is fishy. There does not seem to be a deep
     problem here, but, when programming an error recovery strategy, one
     should pay some attention to this issue. Ideally, perhaps, one should use
     [input_needed] only in a state [s] where an input symbol is normally
     demanded, that is, a state [s] whose incoming symbol is a terminal symbol
     and which does not have a default reduction on [#]. *)
