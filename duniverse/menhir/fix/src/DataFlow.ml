(* Such a data flow analysis problem could also be solved by the generic least
   fixed point computation algorithm [Fix.Make.lfp]. However, such an approach
   would be less efficient, as (1) it would require reversing the graph first,
   so to have access to predecessors; (2) whenever a dirty node is examined,
   the contributions of all of its predecessors would be recomputed and
   joined, whereas the forward data flow analysis algorithm pushes information
   from a dirty node to its successors, thereby avoiding recomputation along
   edges whose source is not dirty; (3) the generic algorithm performs dynamic
   discovery of dependencies, whereas in this situation, all dependencies are
   explicitly provided by the user. *)

(* We require a minimal semi-lattice, equipped with a [leq_join] operation, as
   opposed to a semi-lattice, which offers separate [leq] and [join]
   operations. Although [leq_join] is less powerful, it is sufficient for our
   purposes, and is potentially more efficient than the sequence of [leq]
   [join]. *)

     when it is already in the stack. (In principle, a map of variables to
     [unit] should suffice, but our minimal map API does not offer a [remove]
     function. Thus, we have to use a map of variables to Booleans.) *)
