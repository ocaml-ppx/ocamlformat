(**[Tabulate] offers facilities for tabulating a function, that is, eagerly
   evaluating this function at every point in its domain, so as to obtain an
   equivalent function that can be queried in constant time. *)

open Sigs

(**[Make] constructs a tabulator for a finite type that is
   equipped with an implementation of imperative maps. *)

module Make
  (F : FINITE_TYPE)
  (M : MINIMAL_IMPERATIVE_MAPS with type key = F.t)
     : TABULATOR with type key = F.t

(**[ForOrderedType] is a special case of [Make] where it
   suffices to pass a finite ordered type as an argument.
   A reference to a persistent map is used to hold the table. *)

module ForOrderedType
  (F : FINITE_TYPE)
  (T : OrderedType with type t = F.t)
     : TABULATOR with type key = F.t

(**[ForOrderedType] is a special case of [Make] where it
   suffices to pass a finite hashed type as an argument.
   A reference to a persistent map is used to hold the table. *)

module ForHashedType
  (F : FINITE_TYPE)
  (T : HashedType with type t = F.t)
     : TABULATOR with type key = F.t

(**[ForOrderedType] is a special case of [Make] where it suffices to
   pass an arbitrary finite type as an argument. A reference to a
   persistent map is used to hold the table. *)

module ForType (F : FINITE_TYPE)

(**[ForIntSegment] constructs a tabulator for the integer segment [\[0..n)].
   An array is used to hold the table. *)
