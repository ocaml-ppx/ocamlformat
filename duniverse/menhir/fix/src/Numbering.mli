(**[Numbering] offers a facility for assigning a unique number to each value
    in a certain finite set and translating (both ways) between values and
    their numbers. *)

(**The functor [Make] requires an implementation of maps for the type [M.key]
   and offers a two-phase numbering facility. The function [encode] is backed
   by a map, therefore runs in logarithmic time or constant time, depending on
   the type of map that is used. The function [decode] is backed by an array
   of size [n], therefore runs in constant time. *)

(**[ForOrderedType] is a special case of [Make] where it suffices for
   keys to be ordered. *)

(**[ForHashedType] is a special case of [Make] where it suffices for
   keys to be hashed. *)

(**[ForType] is a special case of [Make] where keys can have arbitrary type.
   OCaml's built-in generic equality and hash functions are used. *)
