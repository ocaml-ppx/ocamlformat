(* The module [Fix] that we present to the final user is obtained as a
   combination of several modules, as follows. *)

(* Define all signatures in the toplevel structure. We expect the user to
   declare [open Fix] and to have direct access to all of these signatures,
   under unqualified names. *)

include Sigs

(* Give access to the following modules as submodules. Thus, if the user has
   declared [open Fix], then she can use [Glue], [Memoize], etc. If she
   hasn't, then she must use [Fix.Glue], [Fix.Memoize], etc. *)

module Glue           = Glue
module Memoize        = Memoize
module Numbering      = Numbering
module GraphNumbering = GraphNumbering

module Gensym         = Gensym
module HashCons       = HashCons
module DataFlow       = DataFlow

module Prop = struct

  (**[Prop] offers a number of ready-made implementations of the
     signature [PROPERTY]. *)

  (**The lattice of Booleans. *)
  module Boolean = Boolean

  (* The following declarations are set up so that the user sees
     [Prop.Option] and [Prop.Set] as functors. *)

  (**The lattice of options. *)
  include Option

  (**The lattice of sets. *)
  include Set

end

(* As a special case, [Core] is renamed [Fix]. Thus, if the user has declared
   [open Fix], then she can still use [Fix.Make], [Fix.ForHashedType], etc.
   (This seems nice.) If she hasn't, then she can still use [Fix.Make],
   because we define an alias for [Make] one level up. This is required for
   compatibility with earlier versions of [Fix] (2013-2018), where [Fix.Make]
   was the sole entry point. *)
